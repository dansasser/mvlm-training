Praying in God’s Will
To increasingly reflect God’s glory in the world, ask for His wisdom and power.
Paul fervently desired that the body of Christ—individually and corporately—become spiritually mature. The apostle asked that we believers would know God’s will and then ...
Live a godly life (Col. 1:10). Paul prayed for our character, conversation, and conduct to be consistent with the Lord’s. Our lives ought to be an extension of His—with eyes that look compassionately at others, hands that offer help, and mouths that speak forgiveness and love. A believer’s character, while imperfect, should reflect Christ’s righteousness.
Make our life count (v. 10). God cares deeply about what’s done in obedience to Him. Jesus spoke about the importance of bearing much fruit, which is possible only when we stay connected with Him (John 15:5).
Experience God’s power (Col. 1:11). Through the Holy Spirit’s presence, we have all we need in order to do our Father’s will.
Remain committed and grateful (v. 12). God answers in His perfect timing. In the meantime, we should be steadfast in prayer and thankful for everything He’s already done.
Whenever we pray these verses, our petitions are in accordance with God’s will. And 1 John 5:14-15 tells us our Father responds affirmatively to prayers that align with His purposes.
