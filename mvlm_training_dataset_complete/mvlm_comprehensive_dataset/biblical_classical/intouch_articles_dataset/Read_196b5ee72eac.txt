God always does what is right, remains true to His promises, and is completely reliable.
All of us experience times when circumstances feel unbearable, prayers appear to go unanswered, and God seems distant.
During such periods of helplessness, some believers falter in their faith, while others grow stronger. What is it that can cause such opposite responses to suffering? The key may be one’s understanding of and trust in God’s faithfulness. The Lord never changes (Psalms 90:1-2)—He always does what is right, remains true to His promises, and is completely reliable.
Do we trust Him enough to obey, even when it seems foolish? Are we confident He answers prayers, even when we don’t see an immediate response? Are we sacrificing our selfish ways and desires because we believe His promise of eternity, joy, and peace? An answer of “no” may indicate a deficient understanding of God. That’s why reading the Bible is so important—through Scripture’s countless illustrations of our Father’s attributes, we learn who He is and increasingly trust Him.
Thankfully, the Lord’s steadfastness does not depend upon our circumstances, our feelings, or even our own faithfulness. He is true to His Word and true to Himself. Consider this: How might your life be different if you had complete confidence that God was trustworthy and unchanging?
