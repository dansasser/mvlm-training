Because God is wise and all-knowing, you can place complete confidence in His plan for your life.
Because God has complete knowledge and wisdom (Romans 11:33), He knows exactly how each of His children is to live. In our human, finite understanding, however, we sometimes struggle to figure it out. Consider these five common obstacles:
Doubt is one reason we might miss what God has planned for our life—we wonder whether He is really interested in our problems and question His plan.
A sense of unworthiness can also hamper us. If we feel undeserving, we might refuse to trust God and His plan for us.
Busyness often leads to drifting. Because we’re tied up in other things, we stop asking what God wants for us.
Fear clouds our judgment and hinders our ability to understand and follow His plan.
Willful sin­—such as persisting in thoughts or actions even when we know they’re wrong—prevents us from living in the center of God’s purposes.
Replace these five hindrances with the truth: The cross of Christ reveals both God’s trustworthiness and our value in His eyes. It establishes Jesus’ importance and emphasizes the perfection of God’s plans for our life.
