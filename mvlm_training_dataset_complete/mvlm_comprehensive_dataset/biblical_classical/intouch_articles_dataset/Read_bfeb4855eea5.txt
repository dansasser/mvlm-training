The Gospel of God’s Grace
Eternal love and security belong to all who believe Jesus died and rose again.
The apostle Paul had a ministry to fulfill and a message to deliver— about faith that saves. His words in today’s passage from Acts 20 help us understand the foundational concept involved in our salvation. Paul called it “the gospel of God’s grace” (v. 24).
We’re saved simply because God is gracious. We could never do enough righteous works to bridge the gap between our sin and His holiness. That’s why you’ll never hear of “the gospel of the Law of God.” Can you imagine singing, “Amazing law, how strict the sound that saved a wretch like me”? We could never fulfill the requirements, especially when you consider how Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount expanded the law’s meaning (Matthew 5:1-48; Matthew 6:1-34; Matthew 7:1-29). But grace is totally different. It has nothing to do with our worthiness or performance but is based solely on God’s favor and love.
What’s most remarkable is that the avenue for our salvation is through faith alone. The grace God extends is His gift—not anything we can add to with our works (Ephesians 2:8-9).
Praise God for His wonderful plan. Christ paid our sin debt with His death, and all we have to do is believe it. Even after salvation, God’s grace keeps flowing. We never have to worry that we aren’t good enough and will fall out of favor. His grace is forever.
