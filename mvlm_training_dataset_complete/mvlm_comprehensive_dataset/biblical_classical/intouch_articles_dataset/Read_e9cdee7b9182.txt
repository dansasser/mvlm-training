The Struggle With Guilt
Genuine conviction from God is a gift to save us from the suffering that follows sin.
The way believers deal with guilty feelings has a lot to do with what they understand about guilt. By definition, the word refers to a sense of wrongdoing—an emotional conflict arising from second thoughts about an action or thought. The biblical method for clearing away such feelings is repentance.
However, many believers are plagued by false guilt, which is not actually rooted in sin. This unhealthy feeling can develop in a couple of ways. First, if a church is caught up in legalism, a member may not do enough of what is “required” (such as praying, Bible reading, or witnessing). And second, hearing believers’ criticisms of others can also lead to misplaced feelings of guilt. Without clear discernment, a person may get the sense that he can’t measure up to God’s standards.
Whatever the cause of false shame, it is not the result of sinful behavior. Genuine, biblically based conviction, on the other hand, is an anxiety in the spirit over a definite, willful sin; it is the Holy Spirit’s loving pressure to correct a specific wrong. When we understand this, we can reject Satan’s attempts to distract us with lies. And regardless of the cause, false guilt must be unearthed and removed from the believer’s life.
