When God Makes Us Wait
God is always working for our good—even when it seems as if nothing is happening.
On the road of life, decisions are like intersections; we must choose which way to go. If we barrel through without seeking Jesus Christ, the road we pick may lead to regret and hardship (Matthew 7:13-14). Although the Lord is ready and willing to offer direction, He doesn’t always give it when or how we expect.
At times, this is because He wants to get our attention. When everything is running smoothly, we might be tempted to forget God. But uncertainty draws us back to Him like a magnet. By aligning our steps with His and walking in submission to the Spirit, we open our ears to hear His voice.
Our waiting period is God’s preparation time. He may be coordinating events to line up with His will. Sometimes He has work to accomplish in us before we can handle what He’s planned for our future. Waiting helps strengthen us spiritually—if we instantly received His direction, we would rarely have the opportunity to exercise our faith.
If impatience tempts you to jump ahead of the Lord’s timing, you risk stepping outside of His will and missing His blessings. But by waiting until He gives clear direction, you will walk in His peace with certainty.
