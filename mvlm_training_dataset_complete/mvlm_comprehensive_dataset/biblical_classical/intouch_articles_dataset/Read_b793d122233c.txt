Change is possible because Jesus broke the power of sin and will help us make God-honoring choices.
The apostle Paul wrote extensively about the character and conduct of believers. He said that as Christians, we are to “walk in a manner worthy of [our] calling” (Ephesians 4:1) and to “be imitators of God” (Ephesians 5:1). His entire letter to the church at Ephesus is a beautiful explanation of what it means to live a godly life.
First of all, we must curtail some of our old habits and behaviors and replace them with new ones that are God-honoring. We have a new nature and should conduct ourselves accordingly. Galatians 5:19-21 lists 15 behaviors that we should avoid. Notice the role anger plays in each of these. It fuels hard feelings and encourages hostility.
As we grow in the Lord, the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23) should replace our ungodly thoughts and actions. If we’ve been quick-tempered, then we need to gain patience. If our anger runs hot, then we’re to become peaceful. Foolishness in speech must give way to the quiet wisdom of Christ. Change is possible because sin’s power over us has been permanently broken.
As new creations, we no longer have to be defined by who we were before salvation (2 Corinthians 5:17). We have been set free to live in a way that is pleasing to God through the Holy Spirit’s transforming work.
