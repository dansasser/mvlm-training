Motivated for Commitment
When our heart's desire is to honor God, He will provide clear direction for the challenges of life.
Although Daniel was living as a captive in Babylon, he resolved in his heart not to violate God’s laws. What motivated this young man to live out such a pledge?
Devotion to God. Daniel determined that he would not disobey God and defile himself. Dedication to God means choosing to be set apart to love, worship, and obey only Him. When we keep Jesus Christ as the focus, our heart will overflow with thanksgiving and we’ll be motivated to stand firm.
Clear direction. If Daniel had refused outright to eat the king’s food, he would likely have lost his life. The Lord gave him and his friends the wisdom they needed to develop an alternate plan—and then also provided them with the courage to ask permission to carry it out. Notice that there was no loud demand, argument, or rebellious spirit. Their behavior was marked by trust in God and dependence on Him.
Through daily prayer and meditation upon God’s Word, we can keep our eyes centered on Christ, our ears attuned to His voice, and our heart motivated to obey. We’ll be able to make the same wholehearted commitment that Daniel did. So ask yourself, How eager am I to do God’s will?
