Dealing With False Teachers
Spending time in the Word protects believers from being led astray by false teaching.
Yesterday, we learned how to identify false teachers. Today, let’s look at how we should respond to them.
False teachers want to create uncertainty in their listeners. In order to gain followers, they claim to possess knowledge that their audience lacks.
Those who have a sound doctrine won’t be led astray. That’s why it’s so important that our faith rest on a solid biblical foundation—for example, that Jesus Christ died for the sins of mankind, the Holy Spirit dwells in believers, and Christians will one day be resurrected bodily. These are all rock-solid truths we can rely on. When confronted, we must defend our faith with Scripture we ourselves have studied. We are told in 1 Peter 3:15, “Sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence.” By regularly reading and applying God’s Word, we will be better prepared to explain our beliefs when presented with falsehoods.
Building a sound doctrine is essential because it protects believers and helps them stand firm in their faith. If you already have a study plan in place, keep it up! If you’ve yet to begin one, start small—just five to 10 minutes a day—and go from there.
