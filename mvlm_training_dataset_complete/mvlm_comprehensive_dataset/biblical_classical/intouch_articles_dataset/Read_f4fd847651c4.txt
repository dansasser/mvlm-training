The Thrill of Obedience
Walking by faith leads to unimaginable blessings.
Christians sometimes approach obedience as a way to avoid the negative consequences of disobedience. When this happens, obeying becomes a heavy burden. But God intended our walk of faith be a thrilling adventure, motivated by our love for Jesus and our desire to please Him. Obedience is about discovering more and more of God—not simply avoiding unpleasant outcomes.
Some may equate doing God’s will with the word burden because weighty decisions may be involved. Yet the Lord doesn’t give us anything we can’t handle. Our obedience in the smaller matters of life prepares us for bigger issues.
When we place trust in the Lord’s omnipotence and act on His prompting, life becomes exciting (1 Samuel 15:21-22). And we need not be fearful—for two reasons. First, God has promised to walk through our challenges with us (Hebrews 13:5). And second, He already knows the good that will result when we do what He asks. In fact, after taking one step in obedience, we will have opportunities to do so again, and to experience more of His goodness.
As you walk into this new year, ask yourself, What is my next step of obedience?
