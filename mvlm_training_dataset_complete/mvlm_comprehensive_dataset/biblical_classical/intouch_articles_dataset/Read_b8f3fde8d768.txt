The Moments That Sustain Us
When trouble comes, turn your attention from the problem to Almighty God.
When life falls apart, what do you do?  We all face circumstances that challenge our peace. Unless we have purposeful focus, joy fades and hope seems unattainable.
Let’s consider David’s experience. He endured extreme hardships, including the profound grief of losing a child and a best friend. And King Saul selfishly pursued him in an attempt to take his life. Later, David’s own son led a rebellion against him. And these were just some of the many difficulties he faced. Yet David found hope and peace in God (Psalms 62:5-6).
How was his soul sustained? In order to know the Lord better and obey Him, David focused his mind and spirit on God’s character, ways, and will. We should follow David’s example. Our role during difficulty is to set our eyes on our Father and meditate on His Word. By continually pondering the attributes and ways of the Lord, David found solace in the midst of turmoil.
What consumes your thoughts during the day? Do you have time set aside to dwell solely on the Lord? Remind yourself periodically to bring your attention back to the Creator—one way to do this is to read through the psalms and notice how the author refocuses on almighty God.
