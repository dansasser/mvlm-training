Trust God and obey Him today, even if you don't understand what He's doing.
Faith is the foundation of the Christian life. Hebrews 11:1 gives us the biblical definition: “Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.” True belief is more than something we say; it is a path we follow. Throughout life, God takes us on a journey, allowing us to experience a real relationship with Him as we face each circumstance.
Today’s passage illustrates that God has a purpose for everything we encounter. After promising Abraham descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky (Genesis 15:5), the Lord directed him to obey several commands. Abraham was not told the details of this plan but, thankfully, trusted God anyway. Though the soon-to-be patriarch didn’t obey perfectly, he did step forward in faith, believing in the Lord’s ultimate purpose.
We can know that God is orchestrating a beautiful plan for us, too. He reveals what the next step will be (Psalm 119:105), and our job is to obey, even when it doesn’t seem to make sense.
If you want to know what the Lord is doing in your life, obey Him. Even when you don’t understand the intricacies of the plan, you can trust the goodness of His heart. Rest assured that all He does is purposeful and for your benefit. So step forward in faith and experience His loving care.
