Even with imperfect faith, we can bring our needs to Jesus.
In today’s passage, a man brings his demon-possessed son to the Lord. Having watched the boy suffer since childhood, this father first approaches while Jesus is away but is unable to receive help from the disciples.
When he finally reaches Jesus, the father experiences a hesitation in his faith. “If You can do anything,” he says, “take pity on us and help us!” (v. 22). Jesus, sensing the man’s doubts, replies, “‘If You can?’ All things are possible to him who believes” (v. 23). Without hesitation, the father realizes the disparity between his words and actions, and he cries, “I do believe; help my unbelief” (v. 24). What are we to think—does this man have faith or not?
Yet when we look more closely, we realize that this father was crying out in complete, unashamed honesty to the Lord. He knew that there was no point in attempting to “puff up” his faith before Jesus. Instead, he humbly admits that, while he does in fact believe in Jesus’ saving power, some things—such as his concern for his son—can still interfere with his faith in God.
The Lord is sovereign over all things (Psalm 103:19). We can be honest with Him about our faith. His power does not ebb and flow along with our confidence in Him. Regardless of how we feel, we can trust that God is always in control.
