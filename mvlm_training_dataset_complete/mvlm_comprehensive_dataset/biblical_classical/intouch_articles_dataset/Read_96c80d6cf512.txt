Our loving heavenly Father makes His wisdom available to us daily—we just have to ask.
When you’re facing a decision, no matter how big or small, it’s important to wait on God’s direction and timing. And though it may sound paradoxical, here are three ways that we can take an active role in the waiting process:
1. We should examine our heart, asking the Holy Spirit to expose any wrongs. If He brings something to light, it’s important to take care of that sin immediately—by confessing, repenting, and doing whatever is needed to correct the situation.
2. When seeking direction, we should listen patiently and attentively for the Lord. A neutral mindset can help us hear Him clearly, but waiting can be hard—especially when logic, emotions, or personal preference leads us to favor one option over all others.
3. The answer to our prayer at times requires our involvement. We have responsibility not only to present God with requests and seek His guidance but also to take part, when necessary, in carrying out His will.
Prayer is a beautiful privilege that the heavenly Father gives to His children. He desires to lead us into a life of abundance, and we should participate by seeking His will and listening for His voice. As we follow the Holy Spirit’s guidance, we will experience all that the Lord has for us.
