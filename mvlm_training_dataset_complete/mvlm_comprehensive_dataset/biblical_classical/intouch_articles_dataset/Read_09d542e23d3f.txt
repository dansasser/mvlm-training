Overcoming Insecurity
Choosing to believe what God says about you is the key to gaining freedom from insecurity.
Yesterday, we discussed the hidden dangers of insecurity and some steps to overcome it. But having a sense of security is more than simply building self-esteem. Jesus Christ is our genuine source of strength and confidence. If we attempt to overcome our insecurity without Him, we’ll simply be masking it.
The way we see ourselves isn’t necessarily the way we truly are. Instead, we have to ask the Lord how He sees us. To shift our focus from ourselves and our mistakes, we must get into God’s Word. Scripture is so powerful that when we read what the Lord says about us, our thinking begins to change, and we can avoid insecurity’s destructive mindset.
To continue the process, focus on the positive qualities you possess—good things that make you uniquely and wonderfully you. Take a blank sheet of paper, and ask the Lord to guide you in writing an honest assessment of your traits. But be careful not to look at others’ talents to see how you measure up. No one’s like you, so it’s pointless to make comparisons. You’ll be surprised at what God shows you about yourself. Remember, you’re fearfully and wonderfully made (Psalm 139:14). He created you with a unique purpose, and He wants you to trust Him as the source of your identity and security.
