Peace and comfort come when we regularly allot time to spend in our heavenly Father's presence.
It’s always wise to reexamine our heart with regard to prayer. Let’s look at the values Jesus modeled for us in His practice of setting apart time to spend with His Father.
Solitude. Though Jesus was often surrounded by people, He also understood His own need for seclusion. He would retreat from the crowds—and even His disciples—to speak to God alone.
Safeguarded time. No matter what else was going on, Jesus made it a point to protect periods of time so He could rest in the Spirit, focus on His relationship with the Father, and build up His physical and emotional strength.
Stillness. What does it mean to be still? Psalm 46:10 calls us to stillness with these words: “Stop striving and know that I am God.” To learn this perpetual inner peace, periodically stop everything you’re doing, and simply let your soul become aware of the Holy Spirit’s presence. In today’s reading, David described it as the state of a “weaned child” who is at perfect rest and happy just to be in his mother’s arms.
If you make these essentials a priority, you will reap tremendous benefits in your walk of faith. Doing so may seem challenging. But when you quiet your heart, you’ll discover how much you need the peace of the Lord’s presence. It is a priceless gift!
