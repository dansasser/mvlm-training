For the Bowers, ministry isn't merely a task, but the very life they lead.
Tim Rhodes January 14, 2024
For at-risk women in Chiang Mai, Thailand, Nice and Andrew Bowers and their children aren’t just ministers—they’re a second family. Seeking the warmth and safety of a loving home, some guests stay for months while at university; others simply come for advice. Each night, Nice prepares dinner for a dozen or more as Andrew leads a Bible study.

Since Nice was young, her parents modeled this radical welcome in an effort to rescue girls from human trafficking. She saw firsthand the struggles of poverty and the hopelessness of family trauma. Now she and Andrew also care for girls far from the mountain villages they call home.
Seeing the bright faces around the table, Bowers is grateful for this ministry that trains women to be bearers of hope—to their communities and beyond.
“I see their joys and their gifts. We want them to know that they are daughters of God and they are valued.”
