A Realistic View of Life
Because of Jesus, we don’t have to fear anything now or in the future.
Our culture desperately tries to postpone death. Vitamins, exercise, and eating well—we try them all to live as long as possible. None of these things are bad. Our motive, however, is the key.
For instance, knowing our body is God’s temple (1 Corinthians 3:16), we should take care of His dwelling. On the other hand, if we are trying to live longer because we’re afraid of dying, then that is not of God—His Word teaches us fear isn’t from Him (2 Timothy 1:7). But more than that, since Jesus died in our place, all who trust in Him as their Savior need not dread death. In fact, the apostle Paul assures us that, far from being a terrifying change, physical death actually leads believers home to be with the Lord forever (2 Corinthians 5:8).
In light of these truths, it’s wise to be prepared. The first step is to make sure you know Jesus as your Lord and Savior. Next, live a surrendered life and strive to walk according to His will. Since it’s an inescapable fact that life on earth is temporary, ask, How can I best live in order to be ready when God decides it is time?
