We can show others the heart of God by caring for them as He does.
In today’s well-known passage, Jesus tells a parable about a man with two sons. The younger son made an untimely request for his share of the inheritance and then left for a faraway place. After spending all he had, the young man decided to return home and beg for his father’s forgiveness. When he was still a long way off, his father ran to welcome him—no apologies necessary.
Jesus’ parable about the prodigal son never mentions the word love directly, but it’s there in every one of the father’s actions. Putting yourself in the father’s place and then the younger son’s,  reread today’s passage with an eye toward expressions of love. What examples can you find? Notice that godly love enables us to:
Respond graciously in trying circumstances.
Sacrifice without complaining.
Wait patiently for others instead of pushing them to change.
Forgive those who have wronged us.
Give generously and serve joyfully at all times.
Assist people who are struggling.
Show kindness to those who misjudge or misunderstand us.
Keeping this parable in mind, how can you begin to love others more fully, as the Lord does?
