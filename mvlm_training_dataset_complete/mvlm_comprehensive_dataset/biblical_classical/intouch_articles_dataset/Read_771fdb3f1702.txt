Overcoming Inadequacy
God will always provide everything you need in order to accomplish His will.
2 Corinthians 2:14-17
2 Corinthians 2:14-17
At one time or another, we’ve all dealt with feelings of inadequacy. Maybe it’s because we lost our temper with our spouse, missed an important work deadline, or were too afraid to say yes to an opportunity at church. How did you feel afterwards? Maybe you were frustrated with yourself or felt as if you didn’t measure up. In today’s passage, Paul asks a question that points to this common insecurity: “Who is adequate for these things?” (v. 16).
Here’s the good news: We are inadequate—but God isn’t. And when we trust Him as our Lord and Savior, we become His children and He gives us His righteousness (John 1:12; 2 Corinthians 5:21). He empowers us and has promised to lead us “in triumph in Christ” (2 Cor. 2:14). But unless we believe Him and step out in faith, we’ll never experience the life He has planned for us.
Feeling inadequate isn’t a sin, but using inadequacy as an excuse is. When God calls us to do something that feels beyond our abilities, we have two choices: We can focus on Christ and proceed in triumph or focus on ourselves and withdraw in defeat.
It’s really a matter of faith. God will always empower us to do what He asks us to accomplish. This doesn’t mean we’ll do everything perfectly, but each step of obedience is a victory that He will bless (Psalms 128:1-2).
