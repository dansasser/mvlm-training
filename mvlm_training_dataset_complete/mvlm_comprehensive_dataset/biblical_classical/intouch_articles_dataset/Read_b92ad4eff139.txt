Mustard Seed Faith Moves Mountains
Every step taken with trust in God has tremendous potential for impact in His kingdom.
In Matthew 17:20, Jesus tells the disciples, “Truly I say to you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.”
All of us should be encouraged by these words. Do you hear the power in them? Remember, a tiny seed of faith can unleash extraordinary possibilities. What matters is not the size of our faith but the object of it—namely, the One who created heaven and earth and holds all things in His hands. In the presence of our omnipotent God, no obstacle is insurmountable and no challenge too great.
When towering adversity confronts us, there might be a temptation to doubt and fret. But at such times we can choose to trust in God’s sovereignty. It helps to find scriptures like Jeremiah 32:17 and to lean into those truths. We can also ask the Lord to give us grace and make faith arise within us.
Keep in mind that God is always on our side, and that means we have no reason to fear (Ps. 118:6 ESV). So, in times of uncertainty, let your mustard-seed faith blossom into bold prayers and courageous action!
