Jesus: Lord of Salvation
Jesus lives in every believer through His powerful Spirit.
Throughout human history, God has initiated a relationship with the people He created. Though He often seemed far away, He consistently revealed Himself in personal encounters and even came to be in the Israelites’ midst (in a pillar of cloud and fire, the tabernacle, and the temple). But eventually, God’s presence—in the form of His own Son—came as a man to live among humankind.
Before Jesus was born, He was given two names:
Immanuel means “God with us,” which speaks of Jesus’ identity. He lived on earth, walked among men, and suffered the weaknesses of humanity. Yet He also displayed the power of almighty God as He healed the sick, calmed the sea, and raised the dead.
Jesus means “The Lord is salvation,” which describes His purpose—to save us from sin by means of His death on our behalf. Jesus took on a human body to offer Himself as a substitutionary sacrifice for the sins of mankind.
Although Jesus is no longer physically on earth, He is still “God with us.” He lives in you through the Holy Spirit, and He has the power to deliver you from any bondage. No sinful habit, painful past, doubt, guilt, or struggle is too difficult for our Savior to overcome.
