God’s Guide to a Fruitful Life
Is the character of the Savior increasingly evident in you?
Jesus told His disciples, “I am the vine, you are the branches; the one who remains in Me and I in him bears much fruit” (John 15:5). As we live the Christian life in dependency on the Holy Spirit, two things will become evident in us.
1. We treasure God’s Word. When we value something, we think about it, study it, and learn all we can about it. By studying the Bible, we learn about God’s character, plans, and promises. Scripture meditation develops our ability to think biblically and deepens our relationship with the Lord. One of the indications that we treasure His Word is a change in behavior—decisions will increasingly be guided by His principles, and actions will reflect the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23).
2. We adorn ourselves with kindness and truth. These two virtues are to be our constant companions. God’s truth has the power to expose ungodly attitudes and behaviors, not only in us but also in others. When this happens, kindness helps to protect relationships from damage. What’s more, it can prevent discord and division in churches. God wants us to speak the truth to one another—but to make sure we do it with loving compassion.
As we walk with the Lord, He’ll grow His fruit in us and teach us to follow Him.
