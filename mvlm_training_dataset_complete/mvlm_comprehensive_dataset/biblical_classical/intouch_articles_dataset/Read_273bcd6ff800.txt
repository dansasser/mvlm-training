The Father’s Protection
Though life isn't always easy, we ultimately have nothing to fear, because God is always by our side.
All good fathers and mothers want to protect their children. You can no doubt recall inspiring reports of a parent running into a burning house to rescue a child, donating an organ to a son or daughter, or sacrificing mightily to give young ones a better, safer life. Stories like these are not only heartwarming but also encouraging—they point us toward the greater reality of God as the One ultimately responsible for our safety. Earthly parents go to great lengths to shelter their little ones, but our heavenly Father is able to do so much more than we could ever ask or imagine (Ephesians 3:20).
Look at the qualities David attributes to God in today’s verses. He calls God his strength, his rock, his fortress, and his shield, just to list a few. When we think about the Lord’s presence in our life, these might not be the first characteristics that come to mind. But they are key to comprehending His role as our ultimate protector. Understanding these divine attributes can help us appreciate God more deeply and strengthen our faith as we watch for Him daily.
Whether you’ve experienced the protection of a good parent or not, you have a strong Father in God, who can be called on in times of trouble (Psalm 34:17). He will be with you in every situation and promises ultimately to bring good from it all.
