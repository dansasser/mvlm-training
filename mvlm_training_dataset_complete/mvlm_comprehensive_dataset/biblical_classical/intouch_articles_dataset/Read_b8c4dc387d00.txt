Failing to Listen to God
Accept and be thankful for godly correction; your life will be better because of it.
In his second letter to Timothy, Paul charged his disciple to preach the Word and to correct and rebuke with great patience (4:2). A pastor could hardly have a more difficult assignment than this, because few people respond well to correction. What you do when you are criticized is a good indication of the maturity of your faith. Scripture tells us that the “one who neglects discipline rejects himself,” whereas the “one whose ear listens to a life-giving rebuke will stay among the wise” (Proverbs 15:31-32).
Every time criticism comes our way, we stand at a crossroads of possibilities for good or evil. Either we embrace correction and grow in maturity, or we reject it and start down the slippery slope described in 2 Timothy 4. In this passage, Paul outlines the behavior of those who become tired of reproof. He says they will reject sound doctrine and instead embrace teachings that “tickle” their ears (v. 3). Then they “will turn their ears away from the truth and will turn aside to myths” (v. 4).
We can’t afford to ignore truth, even when our critics are immature, ignorant, or tactless. Be mindful to stay attuned to God’s voice, regardless of the form it may take.
