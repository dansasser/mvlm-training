Brokenness: The Process
Sometimes God's work in us is painful—but the result is always beautiful.
It’s tempting to think we don’t need much improvement. While many people concede they could probably use a little bit of “maintenance” in some areas, they will usually add, “But I’m a good person.” However, the truth is that the Father refuses to settle for humanity’s meager vision of “good enough.” He wants something so much better for us.
God sees each believer as the person he or she will be when fully yielded to Christ. He then sets about achieving that complete renovation by transforming the present self into the image of His Son (1 Corinthians 15:49). An essential step in God’s remodeling work involves removing whatever is ungodly in our life. This process is often uncomfortable, but it’s worth it! God targets habits, attitudes, and relationships that don’t honor Him. He applies pressure to direct our attention to those places so we’ll surrender them to Him.
Conforming our will to God’s changes who we are. In the midst of our transformation, pain from His tools may temporarily obscure the beauty of His design. But nothing is more splendid to the Lord than a committed, obey-no-matter-what follower. Submit to Him so that He might remake you into the son or daughter He has in mind.
