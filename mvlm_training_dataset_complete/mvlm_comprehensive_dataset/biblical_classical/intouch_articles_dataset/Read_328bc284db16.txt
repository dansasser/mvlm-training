Training in Godliness
Believers need to teach and model how to have a personal relationship with God.
As Christians, we should help children mature into godly people. We want them to believe that the Father has a plan for their life and they’re accountable to Him (Romans 14:12).
It’s important to teach children from a young age about these truths. Biblical principles can shape their thinking, their choices, and their heart. We should carefully explain God’s will, teaching them that they must answer for their behavior—not just to Mom and Dad but to the Lord.
It’s also essential that we teach our children how to communicate with the heavenly Father. Let them observe you turning to the Lord and praying over them. Over time, they will develop the habit of talking with Him. This training will become very important as they grow into adults and become responsible for themselves. Instead of always telling them what to do, teach them how to seek God’s will about the situations and struggles they face. (See James 1:5.)
All of this teaching begins before children establish a personal relationship with Jesus Christ—and we continue the process by demonstrating righteousness throughout life. When we model good character and honorable behavior, our kids are more likely to grow up knowing their loving Father.
