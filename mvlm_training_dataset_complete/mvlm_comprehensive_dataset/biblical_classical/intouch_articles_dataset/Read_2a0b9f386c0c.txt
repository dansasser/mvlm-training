The Name Above All Names
The heavenly Father selected Jesus' name to reflect the Son’s purpose: He came to save the world from sin.
In the ancient world, naming a child was a major event for Hebrew families. Parents took great pains when selecting a name, sometimes choosing one that had personal meaning for them. An example of this is Leah—she called her fourth child Judah (“praised”), saying, “This time I will praise the Lord” (Genesis 29:35). Occasionally, a perceived or desired personality trait would determine what a baby was called. Apparently, this was the case with Jacob (“one who supplants”) in Genesis 25:26.
Mary and Joseph had a far different experience from that of other Jewish parents. Instead of choosing the name themselves, an angel told them what their child would be called (Matthew 1:21). The heavenly Father selected His Son’s earthly name to represent the purpose of His coming. And one day, the very mention of Jesus’ name will cause every knee to bow and every tongue to confess that He is Lord (Phil. 2:10).
The Hebrew form of Jesus means “salvation” or “He saves.” Christ is called many things throughout Scripture: Lord, Immanuel, Teacher, Messiah, and Son of Man. But “Jesus” tells us the most essential thing to understand: He came to save the world from sin, and for that reason, God gave His Son the name above all names.
