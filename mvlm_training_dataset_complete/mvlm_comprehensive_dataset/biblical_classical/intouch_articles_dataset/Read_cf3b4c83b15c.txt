Christ’s Transforming Power
Those who have a personal encounter with Christ are permanently and radically changed.
Ephesians 2:1-2 says that before salvation, we all are spiritually dead. But when a person places faith in Christ, he or she becomes a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17). Nowhere is this more evident than in the life of the woman at the well, recorded for us in today’s passage.
Before Jesus came to Sychar, the Samaritan woman’s life was challenging, to say the least. She was not fully welcome in her community, as evidenced by the fact she was going to draw water during the hottest part of the day, long after others had done so. It’s easy to imagine her walking with her head down and eyes averted, hoping to get what she needed without calling attention to herself.
However, she and Jesus spoke directly—a surprising departure from cultural norms of the time—and what He revealed changed everything. After learning of the living water Christ offered, she no longer ran away from others. Instead, she went right to them to share the amazing news (vv. 28-30). What a transformation! Salvation came to her in a moment when she least expected it, and the same can be true for people in our day.
