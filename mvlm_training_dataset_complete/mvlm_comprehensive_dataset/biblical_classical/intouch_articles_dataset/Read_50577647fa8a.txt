The body of every believer is a temple for Holy God, so we should honor Him with our choices.
1 Corinthians 6:19-20
1 Corinthians 6:19-20
God, who carefully crafted every one of us, places a high value on our bodies (Psalm 139:13). The human form represents the masterpiece of creation, and God entrusted our bodies to our care. Just as with any other resource—such as relationships or money—the Father expects wise stewardship from us.
Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians provides a clear picture of followers of Christ mistreating their bodies. Many people in the church had been engaging in various unacceptable practices, including sexual misconduct and gluttony (1 Corinthians 5:1; 1 Corinthians 11:21). Because of their low view of the physical body, they incorrectly regarded these behaviors as completely separate from their spiritual life. They believed they could do anything they wanted with their bodies and still be considered “good.”
In chapter 3, Paul writes, “Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?” (1 Corinthians 3:16). The apostle reminds us that God’s Holy Spirit has come to live in the heart and life of every believer.
If you have received Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, then He has taken up residence in your life. In effect, your body has become a living temple. What is your body saying about your relationship with the heavenly Father?
