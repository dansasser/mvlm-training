Through the Bible, God reveals who He is, what He is doing, and how the future will unfold for mankind.
The Bible provides an accurate account of God’s character, actions, and purposes. Together, the Old and New Testaments teach us that man’s problem is sin and the only remedy is faith in the Son of God: Jesus Christ.
Through His Word, God has entrusted to us the knowledge of who He is, what He is doing, and how the future will unfold for mankind. The Scriptures were intended to lead us into a growing relationship with our heavenly Father and to empower us for fruitful service as Christ’s ambassadors (2 Corinthians 5:20). In this position, we are called to follow Jesus’ example in glorifying God (Matthew 5:16)—our Savior focused not on Himself but on the Father, whose plan is to reach the entire world with His saving grace.
God’s will includes different tasks for His children to accomplish, according to the way He’s planned for each one to serve (Romans 12:4-6). Meditating on scriptural principles and examples will help us discern what He has in mind for us.
What place does this amazing book—the Bible—have in determining the course of your life? Take time today and every day to listen to the Lord, to partake of His wisdom, and to determine what He is saying to you personally.
