Jesus’ Enduring Presence
The Savior who died for you will stay by you.
Life can feel like a complicated puzzle sometimes, with lots of uncertainties and challenges. But here’s the good news: Jesus tells us in today’s passage that He’s always with us, no matter what. His presence is like a reliable compass, guiding us in the right direction as we navigate the twists and turns of life.
Experiencing God’s presence isn’t just about attending church each week or being part of a monthly Bible study group; it’s a daily thing. As we consistently draw close to Him, He draws near to us (James 4:8).
If you’ve ever had a trustworthy friend who was faithful to walk with you in tough times, you know just how invaluable such companionship can be. And Jesus is the greatest and most loving friend we could ever have—guiding, comforting, and giving us strength. In His presence, we can find peace, courage, and the assurance that we’re never alone.
Take the words of Matthew 28:20 to heart. As we go through life, remember that Jesus is always there. Whether things are going well or not, in the everyday and the extraordinary moments, His presence is our constant. He’s with us always, even to the end of the age.
