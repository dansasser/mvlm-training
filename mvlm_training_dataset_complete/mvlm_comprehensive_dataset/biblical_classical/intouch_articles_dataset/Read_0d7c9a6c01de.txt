Jesus, as the vulnerable Lamb, chose to give His life for us.
Bumblebees and badgers, lions and skunks, black bears and beagles all have one thing in common: If threatened, they attack. But that’s not the case with lambs.
In the Bible, they’re usually mentioned in the context of a sacrificial offering. For example, at the time of the Passover, God rescued His people from Egyptian slavery through lamb’s blood. Imagine the disciples’ shock when John the Baptist introduced Jesus as “the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!” (John 1:29).
Ours is a strange story. Christianity is the only religion with a God who, in love and for love, subjected Himself to be sacrificed at the hand of His own creatures. Of course, Jesus the vulnerable Lamb is also the Mighty One who rules, judges, and triumphs (Revelation 5:6; Revelation 14:9-11; Revelation 17:14)—but even then, He is “the Lamb who has been slain” (Revelation 13:8).
It’s a valiant and unique story—of broken people who have sunk so deep in sin that we cannot lift ourselves out. Someone had to come and rescue us from our self-imposed bondage, even if it meant dying in our place. And that is exactly what our Savior did. Jesus, the lion who came as a lamb, willingly gave His life for us.
