Called for God’s Purpose
Though sometimes we can't see it, God is continually shaping and equipping us to accomplish His purposes.
2 Thessalonians 1:11-12
Esther 2:1-8; Esther 2:17
The book of Esther is filled with intrigue, adventure, and danger. Her ordinary life suddenly became remarkable when she found herself crowned Queen of Persia. We clearly see the Lord’s sovereign hand at work in her story. But can you imagine how confused and uncertain Esther must have felt when it was underway?
We may feel the same sense of perplexity as we live each day, not knowing what the future will bring. Sometimes it is easier to see God’s calling in someone else’s life than in our own. His plans and purposes for us are working out in perfect progression, but from an earthly perspective, the developments may seem chaotic and bewildering.
Esther’s story is an encouragement to trust in God’s will and purposes, no matter what. Every believer in Christ has a calling from the Lord (2 Thessalonians 1:11-12). He continually guides each of His children in the work He has planned for that individual’s life.
God’s calling includes not only what we do but also who we are. Every experience in life is a tool that the Lord uses to shape, equip, and fine-tune us to become the person He intends each one to be.
Begin looking for the Lord’s hand in your life. He is always there, directing and moving.
