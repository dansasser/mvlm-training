Greatness for God’s Glory
The blessings God sends into your life are best enjoyed in service to Him.
Scripture calls David a man after God’s own heart (1 Samuel 13:14). Despite some horrendous failures, he lived a life of greatness. Unlike many others who are raised to positions of power and prestige, David understood that his prominence was not for his own gain but for God’s glory. He knew inherently what Jesus would later teach: “The greatest of you shall be your servant. Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled, and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted” (Matthew 23:11-12).
In today’s passage, David refers to himself as the Lord’s servant and promises that all blessings he receives will be used to honor God’s name. He is conscious of the fact that gifts are bestowed on him and his descendants so the Lord ultimately receives praise.
When we humble ourselves under the divine hand of blessing in this way, God’s glory is made plain to those around us. No matter how humble or high our position in life is by the world’s standards, we must always remember that every good thing we have is from God and for Him (James 1:17). When our heart maintains a posture of thanksgiving and service to our Father, we can become truly great for His sake.
