God gives us the ability to experience His goodness here on earth—no matter what is happening around us.
Whether you study Old Testament passages like today’s or read news headlines, you’ll find the world has no shortage of conflict. It can be disheartening to realize there always have been and always will be leaders more interested in power than justice—leaders for whom winning matters more than how many people are killed or displaced. But Jesus told us that this would happen, that we would “hear of wars and rumors of wars” and, unfortunately, “such things must happen” (Matt. 24:6 NIV). But thankfully, we are citizens of the heavenly kingdom that doesn’t falter.
As believers, we can trust God to guide us, pray for our leaders to have wisdom, and know that everything is under control of the King of Kings. And we don’t need to wait for eternity to begin living in the kingdom of God—it’s already here! In Luke 17:20-21, Jesus told the Pharisees that His kingdom was already present. Today, too, it’s happening among His people, right here and now.
This month, spend time looking for God’s kingdom and the many wonderful ways it manifests itself. Yes, there are always certain leaders out for their own agendas, but look past them to those doing God’s work in quiet and often uncelebrated ways. That’s where you will find the truest beauty, the purest motives, and the trusted friends of God’s kingdom.
