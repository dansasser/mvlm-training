Do you feel far from God? Maybe it’s time to get back to the basics.
John 1:12; John 3:16-17
It’s easy to say that we believe in God, even at times that our heart remains far from Him. That’s a factor of the human condition—not something to punish ourselves over. But it’s wise to be honest with ourselves and the Lord about where we are in our relationship with Him. That’s the best way to move forward and fully experience His peace and joy.
Toward that end, it’s helpful to remember that the simple, basic elements of our faith are more than just simple and basic. They’re profound, transformational realities—not just good or correct thoughts we “believe in.” As Christians, we believe with our whole being. And we grow in faith by regularly including these activities in our routine, as taught in God’s Word:
Sitting quietly and listening for the Holy Spirit.
Reading the Bible with an open heart and mind.
Reviewing the core beliefs and principles of our faith.
Fellowshipping with others who know Christ.
The walk of faith needn’t be more complicated than that, whether you’ve known Christ for two months or 20 years. Find a healthy rhythm of doing these things, without worrying about how you’re performing. You’ll see how rich simple faith truly is.
