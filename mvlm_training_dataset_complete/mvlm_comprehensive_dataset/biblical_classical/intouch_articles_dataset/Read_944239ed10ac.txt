Choose to see the pain in your life from God’s perspective.
Pressure. Stress. Conflict. Broken dreams. Life is full of adversity. When Jesus said we’d have trouble in this world (John 16:33), He wasn’t kidding. Hardly a day goes by that we don’t face some form of a trial. Many are trivial, like getting stuck in traffic or having a tiring day with a sick baby. Others are life-altering, like a devastating diagnosis or the death of a loved one. But according to James 1:2, we should “consider it all joy” when these trials of life come our way. That may not seem possible—yet it is when we choose to see our pain from God’s perspective.
Maintaining a Christlike perspective is easy when life is smooth and we have everything we need; holding on to that perspective when things are falling apart is much more difficult.  Adversity refines us, but to see the positive in the middle of our pain, we must be intentional about choosing to look at things from God’s point of view. That means remembering He loves us and is at work in our life, growing our faith and endurance.
God uses all things—both our joys and our trials—to make us perfect and complete in Him. Keeping that perspective allows us to find joy in a difficult situation. The trials we face in this life make us more like our Father. And for that, we can rejoice.
