Rekindling the Flame of Ministry
Do you need to reawaken your passion for God's work?
What do you do when you’ve lost your enthusiasm for ministry? In today’s reading, Paul tells Timothy to “kindle afresh the gift of God which is in you.” Here’s how to do that:
Refill. Ministry is exciting when we sense the Holy Spirit’s power at full capacity, but everyone loses steam now and then. That’s the perfect moment to ask the Lord to refill our heart.
Refocus. Nothing dims the flame like fixing our eyes on the problem. Whenever we focus on obstacles, they grow larger. But when we shift our eyes to Christ, He becomes bigger than any problem we face.
Reject. When we’re down, the Devil whispers his lies into our mind: You can’t do this. No one appreciates you. Why not call it quits? (See John 8:44.) We need to recognize all discouraging thoughts as coming from him—and not allow them to take root.
Retreat. Spending quiet time with the Lord will rekindle our intimate relationship with Him.
Give these steps a try. After going through them, you’ll be able to return to ministry with new enthusiasm and commitment. Hard circumstances may remain, but you’ll be equipped to handle them because the Spirit’s flame will be burning brightly within you. Rely on Him, and He’ll empower you for service.
