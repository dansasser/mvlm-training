The Priority of Relationship
Our good deeds mean little unless they flow from our love for the Lord.
Ephesus was the home of a tremendous ministry. Despite persecution, the church planted by Paul endured, spread the gospel, and was quick to challenge false prophets. But 30 years after Paul left, John’s revelation included a stern warning for those believers.
Imagine how the words of Revelation 2 must have struck the Ephesian church members. After complimenting their service to the gospel, Christ said, “But I have this against you ...”  The Lord warned them that they had left their first love, and their work was being done with wrong motives. Christ called the Ephesians to remember their love for Him and their delight in His salvation.
The commendable things that we do count for little unless they stem from a vibrant personal connection with God. Our work likely won’t be effective or fruitful unless He is in it. In fact, God is more interested in our personal relationship with Him than anything else. He desires to be the satisfaction and delight of His children so that our service is a result of loving devotion.
The Lord is satisfied when our service is motivated by love for Him. Ask God to help you return to your first love and serve Him with joy and gladness (Psalms 100:1-2).
