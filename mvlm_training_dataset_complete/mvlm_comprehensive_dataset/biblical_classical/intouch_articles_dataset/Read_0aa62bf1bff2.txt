Ask God to help you see the evidence of His love and power in your life.
David was confident that the Lord was always with him (Psalm 16:8). His psalms reveal he was well aware of God’s intimate involvement in his life. Like David, we should train our spiritual eyes to notice evidence of the heavenly Father’s presence.
Seeing with spiritual eyes isn’t a now-and-then kind of thing—it’s a lifestyle. Jesus said, “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God” (Matthew 5:8). Those who walk with the Lord can take captive unholy thoughts, habits, attitudes, and words. They can cast out sin and live in righteousness. As a result, such believers have a spiritual clarity that sharpens their awareness of God’s presence and role in their life.
When you lie down and talk to the Lord before going to sleep, try to recall the events of your day. What you’re really doing is looking for evidence of God’s hand at work. How did He guide a decision? Answer a question? Protect you in a situation? Help you in a relationship? Appreciating the Lord’s handiwork will etch the reality of His love deeper in your heart.
For us as believers, evidence of God’s great power is everywhere in our life, if only we will see it. Viewing the world with wide-open spiritual eyes changes our perspective. We can live confident in our loving, omnipotent God, who dwells within us.
