The Importance of Right Motives
Prioritize pleasing God, and then prepare to be amazed by His work in your life.
David found King Saul’s reward for Goliath’s defeat interesting—in fact, he asked to have it repeated twice (1 Sam. 17:26, 30). However, David may have been young, but he wasn’t foolish. The reward was a nice perk, but it wasn’t the young shepherd’s motivation.
David’s reason for standing against Goliath was to serve the Lord. He openly criticized the giant: “For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he has dared to defy the armies of the living God?” (v. 26). Challenging the chosen nation of Israel was the same as defying the Lord Himself. David was prepared to defend Yahweh’s holy name and His people, even against this fearsome warrior. A right and holy motive gives a person confidence to obey God, even if doing so defies human wisdom.
When facing life’s Goliaths, we might be tempted to approach God with a plea like, I’m tired of being in this mess, or I want to run away but can’t, so You’ll have to remove this problem.
However, the right motive for facing a problem is the desire to follow, serve, and honor God—no matter what. Giant challenges may tax our comfort or wellbeing, but wanting a quick way out can impede our obedient walk with God. So pray, “Lord, help me to stand strong in Your name. And grant me victory over the Goliaths in my life, bringing you honor and glory each step of the way.”
