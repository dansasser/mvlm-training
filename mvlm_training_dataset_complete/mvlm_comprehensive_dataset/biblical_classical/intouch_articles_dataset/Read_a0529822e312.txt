Why We Doubt Our Salvation
It's difficult to live a fruitful, Spirit-filled life if you are unsure of your relationship with the Lord.
It is challenging to live an effective and empowered Spirit-filled life if you constantly doubt your faith. Why, then, do believers so often doubt? Let’s consider some key reasons:
Sin. When disobedience is present in our life, our prayers will be hindered (Psalm 66:18), as will our grasp of spiritual truths. So it’s understandable that sin can muddle a believer’s thoughts about salvation.
False Teaching. For example, if we’ve been taught that salvation is dependent upon good works, we have been misled. Our salvation is based on God’s grace alone.
Overemphasis on Emotions. Too often, people tie their experience of being saved to an emotional high. This leads many believers to doubt their salvation during times of life’s natural “emotional lows.”
Disbelief. Acts 16:31 clearly states, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved.” If you’ve made this saving confession, then you are saved, and nothing can separate you from the Lord.
If you doubt your salvation, prayerfully examine your heart. If any of these falsehoods are hindering your faith, allow the Lord to comfort you with His truth and love.
