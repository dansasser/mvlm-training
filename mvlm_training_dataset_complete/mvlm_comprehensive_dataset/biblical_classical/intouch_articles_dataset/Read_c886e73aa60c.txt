Foundations for the Christian Life
Strength and courage are gained when we regularly spend time with our heavenly Father.
Most of us are familiar with Joshua 1:9, which says, “Be strong and courageous! Do not be tremble or be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.” But if we look at the passage in context, we’ll see that strength and courage are gained through regular intake of Scripture. For this reason, spending time with God by reading His Word should be a priority in our life.
When we’re in daily communion with our Lord, we can more easily trust He is in control of everything (Isaiah 55:8-11). Whether we are pummeled by adversity or overwhelmed with joy, God has our circumstances well in hand. Spending time with the Father allows us to bring Him all of our concerns and feelings. Then He can rejoice with us or comfort us according to our need.
Praying through Scripture and asking God to speak to us about what we read is our privilege as Christians. When we’re quiet before the Lord, we receive His guidance and power for our circumstances. No matter what we’re up against, God restores our weary soul and renews us for another day.
Our lives are packed full of business and distractions, so we should set aside time each day to speak to God in prayer and to study the Scriptures. Doing this faithfully helps build a rhythm that keeps us steady, no matter what comes our way.
