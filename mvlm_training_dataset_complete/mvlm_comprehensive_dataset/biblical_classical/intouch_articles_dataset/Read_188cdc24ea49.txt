The Holy Spirit: God’s Presence
After Jesus returned to heaven, He sent the Holy Spirit to live in us.
Some people think the Holy Spirit’s first appearance was at Pentecost. But He’s mentioned in the creation account (Genesis 1:2) and throughout the Old Testament and Gospels. Then, in today’s passage, the Spirit arrives in the upper room with a fresh mission.
In the Old Testament, the Holy Spirit empowered individuals for specific tasks. For example, Bezalel’s God-given wisdom and craftsmanship enabled him to become the tabernacle’s chief architect (Exodus 31:1-5). We also read that the Spirit settled upon leaders needing help in administration (Numbers 11:16-17), warriors facing formidable tasks (Judges 6:34), and men called to proclaim God’s Word (Ezekiel 2:1-4).
Indicating that the Spirit’s involvement with believers would be different than before, Jesus told the disciples, “He abides with you and will be in you” (John 14:17). God’s Holy Spirit had come alongside them during their time with Jesus but would dwell within them following the ascension.
Since Pentecost, every believer has received the Holy Spirit. If Jesus is the vine and we’re the branches, then the Spirit is the energizing sap that equips us. He no longer comes and goes but now remains permanently. He seals us in Christ—proof of the promise that we are forever in God’s presence (Ephesians 1:13-14).
