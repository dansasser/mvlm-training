Worshipping God with other believers is a privilege provided by Christ—not another duty to perform.
For many believers, Sunday morning goes something like this: Oversleep because the weekend’s late-night fun wasn’t compatible with Sunday’s early-morning responsibilities. Jump out of bed and shower. Make sure everyone’s up. Let the pets out, and scarf down breakfast. Herd the family into the car. Screech into the church parking lot. Run through the front doors of the sanctuary. Plop down in a pew. Open a hymnal. Sing some songs. Hear a sermon. Leave church to go home and take a nap.
Does this sound familiar? There’s obviously something wrong with this scenario: Where is the worship? Sure, this family made it to the service, but praise and study of the Word was just something on their list of activities. There was no room for an encounter with God, because the time of worship seemed to be an interruption of their Sunday, not the focus of it.
Psalm 100:4 tells us to “enter . . . His courtyards with praise.” Does this characterize your experience of worship each week? As we head into the weekend, don’t let the “Sunday rush” become a problem. How can you plan ahead and prepare your heart, mind, and family to meet the King? Remember, worship is not something you have to do; it’s something you get to do (Psalm 122:1)!
