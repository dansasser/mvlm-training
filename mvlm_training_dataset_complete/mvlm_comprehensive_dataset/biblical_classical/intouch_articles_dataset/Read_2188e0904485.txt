What our heart needs most comes only through Jesus.
2 Corinthians 8:9 tells us that Jesus became poor in order that we might have the riches of grace. In other words, He left behind His divinity and took on the limitations of humanity—all for our benefit. As a result, we are:
• Chosen. God chose us from the beginning to belong to Him (2 Thessalonians 2:13), even though we do not deserve His kindness.
• Redeemed. We are no longer held in bondage to sin, because   Jesus paid the penalty we owed (1 Peter 1:18-19).
• Justified. All of us have disobeyed, but in God’s eyes, followers of Christ are “not guilty.” (See Romans 3:23, Romans 3:28.)
• Reconciled. Sin put us at odds with God, but through Christ, our relationship with Him is restored (2 Corinthians 5:18).
• Forgiven. God has forgiven all our past, present, and future sins (Hebrews 10:10).
• Freed from condemnation. We could never have kept the Law perfectly—that’s why Jesus came to fulfill it. As a result, we can pursue holiness without fear of punishment when we fail (Romans 8:1-2).
The above words describe all of us who trust in Jesus whether we’re having a good day or a bad day. God sees us in those terms because He loves us. Along with the apostle Paul, let’s praise God, “who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ” (Eph. 1:3).
