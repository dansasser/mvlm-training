Lighting the Fire Again
Since even good things can be a distraction, choose to prioritize your relationship with God.
Let’s continue looking at the Lord’s warning to the church at Ephesus (Revelation 2:4). The Ephesians’ fervor is gone, though they’re still going through the motions of serving God and even defending the faith.
Christ’s warning to them extends to us, too. He looks at distracted and complacent Christians who are laboring for every reason but the right one, and He cries out, “I don’t want your empty service; I want you!”
Our heart can gradually cool when we give higher priority to other relationships and activities than to the Lord, making them idols in our life. The truth is, anything that distracts from God qualifies as an idol. (See Exodus 20:3-5.) Returning to a life of passionate service for God begins with repentance. We must assume responsibility for drifting away. Then, we’re to put Jesus Christ back on the throne of our heart and reconnect with Him through meditation on Scripture and regular prayer.
God desires an intimate relationship with every believer. Are you excited about Jesus? Our best and purest devotion will be to whatever or whomever we prioritize above all else. If that is not Jesus, repent and ask Him to rekindle the flame.
