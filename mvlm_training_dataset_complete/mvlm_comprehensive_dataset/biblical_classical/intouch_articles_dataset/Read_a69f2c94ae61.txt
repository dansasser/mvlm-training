Our compassionate Savior offers spiritual, physical, and emotional refuge for the hurting.
Yesterday, we learned that God’s character never changes—Jesus Christ always remains the same. What a comfort for believers! And the better we know Him, the easier it will be to turn to Him for refuge. So today, let’s learn more about His nature. Jesus ...
• Forgave others. He showed mercy, not judgment, to those who recognized their sin.
• Comforted the hurting. He visited Mary and Martha, who were mourning the loss of their brother Lazarus (John 11:1-45).
• Provided for needs. After spending three days healing, He was concerned that the large crowd hadn’t eaten. He could have sent all 4,000 away to find their own food, but He provided more than enough to satisfy their hunger (Mark 8:1-9).
• Interceded for His disciples. Just before He was crucified, Jesus asked the Father to protect and sanctify His followers, including you and me (John 17:15-20).
• Strengthened believers and gave them power to do God’s work. In Acts 1:8, the Lord sent His disciples out to share the gospel, assuring them, “You will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you.”
Jesus still forgives, still comforts, still provides, still intercedes, and still empowers. What a blessing that we can find refuge in our amazing Lord!
