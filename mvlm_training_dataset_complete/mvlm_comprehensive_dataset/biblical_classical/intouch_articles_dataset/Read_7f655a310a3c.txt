What Does Growth Look Like?
God's character should be increasingly evident in those being transformed by the Holy Spirit.
When branches are full and spilling over with big, bright fruit, we assume the tree is healthy. We may not be able to see the quality of the soil, and we probably didn’t witness the tree being fertilized or pruned. But looking at its boughs, we can see the evidence of steady growth and regular maintenance.
Likewise, fruit in our spiritual life indicates health and maturity in a believer. And today’s passage lists nine traits that show up in our life when God’s Holy Spirit dwells in us: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. But how should we watch for these? What are the signs we’re moving in the right direction? When we’re growing in Christlikeness, these qualities are evident as we:
• Bear with the shortcomings of others.
• Use our words more carefully.
• Give and serve more cheerfully.
• Resist temptation and, when we sin, repent quickly.
• Keep our promises to God and others.
• Respond to challenges with peace and patience.
Most of the people we interact with on a daily basis won’t see our efforts, but they will notice the Lord’s character forming in us. Using the list above, take inventory. Which traits need more emphasis in your life?
