God Deserves Our Reverence
Have you forgotten just how amazing our great God is? Spend time remembering today.
“My daddy is stronger than your daddy!” “My mom makes the best food in the whole world!” Have you ever noticed little children instinctively trust their mother and father and often speak of them with pride? To an innocent toddler, no one is smarter, prettier, or funnier than his or her parents.
But at some point, things start to change. As children grow up and observe the world around them, the unwavering admiration they once had begins to falter—especially by the teenage years. Then, perceptions of parents can shift, causing indifference and ingratitude. What happened? Teens naturally want to feel independent, which leads to questioning parental views and discovering that Mom and Dad are fallible human beings.
Take a moment to check your heart right now. Jesus said that we should be like little children (Matthew 18:3). Do you adore and admire your heavenly Father? Do you talk to others about Him with the same reverence and joy as when you first believed? If any of that delight has faded, ask Him to help you rediscover it. Then spend time in His Word, watching for His personal encouragement to you.
