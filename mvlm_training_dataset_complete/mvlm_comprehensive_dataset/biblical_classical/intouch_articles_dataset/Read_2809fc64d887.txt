By prayer, Wini Jackson is seeking God’s heart for the next generation.

Imagine a group of teenagers splashing in the Pacific Ocean for the first time—even though they’ve lived only a few miles away since birth. Or children growing up without books at home, learning to read much later than their peers. For decades, Wini Jackson has served the youth of Los Angeles County, providing experiences, educational opportunities, and resources they otherwise couldn’t access. When she founded Reclaiming Our Youth, an advocacy organization aimed at helping children in crisis, she resolved to always seek God’s heart for them. Thousands have benefited from her actions.

In everything she says and does, Jackson insists that the Lord receive the glory—He’s the One who loves these children more than anyone could imagine. Each morning she prays, “God, what assignment do You have for me today?” A listener of In Touch since its inception, Jackson embraces Dr. Stanley’s call to “obey God and leave all the consequences to Him” as a way of life.
More than 200,000 L.A. youth live in poverty, and 12.6% of people aged 16-24 are considered “disconnected”—in neither school nor the workforce. The ministry efforts of Wini Jackson and those like her are vital to the flourishing of the next generation.
