David delighted in knowing God and sought Him earnestly.
King David made mistakes. Yet he was called a man after God’s own heart and was used mightily by the Lord. What set him apart was the priority he placed on his relationship with the Father. David delighted in knowing God and sought Him earnestly. When he wrote, “My soul thirsts for You, my flesh yearns for You,” it was a declaration that God’s love was better than life. He pledged to praise the Lord all his days (Psalm 63:1; Psalms 63:3-4).
David viewed life from a God-centered perspective. In his writings, he marveled at the Lord’s creative power in the world, expressed reliance on Him for protection and strength, and proclaimed allegiance. He also prayed fervently and frequently, lifting up requests and expectantly awaiting a response (Psalm 5:3).
Both praying and worshipping fueled David’s trust in the Lord. And his faith sustained him throughout life—as a shepherd boy protecting sheep from wild animals, as a young man facing the giant Goliath, and as God’s anointed leader over the people of Israel.
The psalms reveal that David desired to know the Lord and sought His guidance. Likewise, Paul urges us to prioritize knowing Jesus so our faith will rest on the power of God (1 Corinthians 2:2-4). May we give Christ precedence over all else in our life.
