A close relationship with the Lord is built by dedicating time to spend with Him—day by day, year by year.
A close relationship with the Lord doesn’t happen accidentally. It requires continual, deliberate decisions to pursue Him. Intimacy can’t be achieved in an inspiring weekend conference, nor can it be accomplished by reading a chapter or two of the Bible and praying indifferently. Seeking God is a lifetime commitment—day by day, year by year.
Too many believers are satisfied to have a shallow, superficial relationship with the Lord. They’ll approach God for relief from suffering or fulfillment of other needs but are unwilling to sit quietly for an extended period of time just getting to know Him through prayer and His Word. Yet the most important pursuit in a believer’s life is building a relationship with God. (See Ps. 27:4.) To forfeit this great blessing is a tragedy.
God doesn’t need anything from you, but He desires your loving devotion and intimate fellowship. Ask yourself, Is this what I want, too? If your answer is yes, are you willing to make the necessary commitment? Seeking the Lord cannot be something you hurry through or approach casually (Psalm 63:1). It will cost you time and effort, but the rewards are worth any sacrifice.
