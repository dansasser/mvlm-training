Almighty God—who protects, provides, refreshes, and renews us—is worthy of our trust.
Today’s verse gives language to a truth that resonates deep within us all: “Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but desire fulfilled is a tree of life.”
Trees grow from tiny seeds, extending their branches toward the sky. In a way, believers are like trees. Our faith in the Lord is like a seed planted in fertile soil. It takes root and begins to sprout, stretching toward the heavens. Then, as we draw strength and nutrients from the Creator, our hope in Him matures, bearing good fruit that nourishes and satisfies our heart.
As we abide in the Lord, He protects us during life’s trials and becomes our refuge. He alone sustains us with the fruit of joy, peace, and fulfillment, refreshing our spirit while renewing our strength.
In order for our hope in God to grow strong, it needs to be watered with prayer, worship, and trust. Then we will become like rooted and established trees, radiating God’s glory and bearing the fruit of His Spirit. As Isaiah 61:3 says, “So they will be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that He may be glorified.”
