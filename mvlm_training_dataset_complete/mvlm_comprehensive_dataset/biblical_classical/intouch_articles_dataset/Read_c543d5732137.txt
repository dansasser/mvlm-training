An Invitation Back to the Future
Understanding God’s plan for tomorrow helps us make better choices today.
In A Christmas Carol, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come shows Ebenezer Scrooge grave images of his future. Scrooge cries, “No, Spirit! Oh, no, no! ... Hear me! I am not the man I was … Why show me this, if I am past all hope?” Through his fictional work, Charles Dickens wanted to show readers a very real truth: Making necessary changes in their life today leads to a different, better future.
For followers of Jesus, the book of Revelation points to this reality in a sobering but ultimately hopeful way—not as a work of fiction, but as a powerful, prophetic truth. The opening verses of Revelation carry a promise for us: “Blessed is the one who reads, and those who hear the words of the prophecy and keep the things which are written in it; for the time is near” (1:3).
Revelation invites us to peer ahead to the future so we will repent of our sin and live faithfully—today and every day. We can be assured that the Author and Finisher of our faith knows the end of the story. And He calls us to live in readiness, repentance, and hope as we journey toward eternity with Him.
