Jesus can set you free from the shackles of sin.
1 Corinthians 6:12-20
1 Corinthians 6:12-20
In his first letter to the church at Corinth, Paul tells Christians that freedom in Christ is a serious responsibility. Yes, we can eat what we want, spend our time as we please, and pursue activities that we enjoy. However, as believers, we are inseparably joined to Christ’s church. This means that when we die, we are raised up to live with Him forever. And even before that time, while we live on this earth, our bodies and souls are united with Christ
(1 Cor. 6:17). Simply put, they are not our own.
As temporary occupants of these bodies, we have the responsibility to find out what is and is not good for them. Notice the distinction that Paul makes between freedom and reckless abandon: God’s grace and forgiveness cover our sins, but that doesn’t give us permission to engage in harmful behavior. As followers of Jesus, we’re to give ourselves over to the pursuit of godly living. Christians are “earthen vessels,” created by God to fulfill His purpose and bring honor and glory to Him (2 Corinthians 4:7).
True freedom means living without the chains of sin and destructive behavior. Jesus Christ released you from those bonds. Therefore, do not put your body into slavery to damaging habits. Instead, glorify God with your whole self—heart, mind, soul, and body.
