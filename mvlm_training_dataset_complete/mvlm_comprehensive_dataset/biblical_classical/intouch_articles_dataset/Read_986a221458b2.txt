Our Convictions—Our Defense
Build your life on the Word of God—it's always true.
A person of conviction is confident his or her beliefs are true. In contrast, many people choose to believe something based on conditions and circumstances. And if those situations change, so do opinions and loyalty.
Let’s look at two men from Scripture who remained firm in their convictions. Despite years of unfair treatment, Joseph never wavered in his commitment to godly principles. As a result, he was in the right place at the right time to ensure the survival of Israel (Genesis 50:20). Daniel, another righteous man living in an idolatrous land, earned the trust of foreign kings by standing firm in his beliefs (Daniel 1:19-20).
As these heroes of the faith show, godly convictions withstand the changing winds of opinion and the persuasive arguments of opponents. If we’re grounded in the Word and trust what God has said, we can stand firm. Confidence breeds the courage to remain strong amid the conflicts that arise.
Instead of following your own preferences, choose to live a life based on godly convictions and the values Scripture says are most important. Through prayer and study, the heavenly Father will firmly root us in solid biblical convictions that will withstand the pressures of any trial.
