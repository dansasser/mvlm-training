Experiencing God’s Goodness
God is always good—even when life is hard.
When life is pleasant, it’s easy to praise God because His kindness is evident. But we may have difficulty recognizing pain and trouble as an expression of His loving care. In difficult times, we need to trust today’s passage, which tells us that the Lord has stored up goodness for those who take refuge in Him (v. 19).
We may not always feel that God is acting favorably toward us. The difficult and painful situations in our life can hinder our understanding of divine goodness. If we believe the Lord is good only when our circumstances are enjoyable, then we misunderstand His nature. But as we seek God and grow closer to Him, we learn His character and ways. Then we’ll begin to see evidence of His goodness in all situations—even our trials. And in His love and wisdom, He’ll use those trials to help shape our character.
Today, when God allows something we don’t like, let’s seek Him, pour out our heart, and listen earnestly. In doing so, we’ll find that our gratitude and trust will grow.
We live under the umbrella of God’s goodness. When circumstances and emotions tell you otherwise, rely on what you know. Throughout the day, look for signs of His loving care for you. Then, as your perspective changes, you will see the signs of His goodness everywhere you turn.
