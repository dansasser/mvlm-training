When we submit to God, His abundant goodness is poured into our life.
1 Corinthians 6:19-20
1 Corinthians 6:19-20
As we read yesterday, God wants us to surrender our life to Him—to become a living and holy sacrifice. This is no small task. All our plans and desires must be subject to His leadership and will. Have you ever wondered why God would make this big ask of us?
It turns out that surrender is in our best interest. Scripture promises again and again that following our Father leads to hope and an established future:
• David observed that goodness is abundant for anyone who defers to God (Psalm 31:19).
• To Jeremiah, the Lord promised that prosperity, hope, and a future are a byproduct of seeking Him wholeheartedly (Jeremiah 29:11-12).
• Solomon noticed our paths are straight when we trust the Lord completely (Proverbs 3:5-6).
So, while God demands our whole life, He promises the sacrifice will be worth it. What’s more, He pledges to care for us, provide for us, and accompany us always.
Jesus’ way is best, and it offers hope, joy, and peace. While we may not like everything He chooses, He promises to work all things for good. Do you want to try handing God the reins today? If you’re not sure, take a moment to tell Him that now. He loves you unconditionally and will meet you where you are.
