The Price of Prayerlessness
If you want to live with peace and purpose, make time in prayer a priority.
Have you ever noticed what happens if we allow our prayer life to fall by the wayside? When we fail to make prayer a priority in our life—essentially forfeiting our time alone with the Father—we will begin to feel an emptiness in our heart, accompanied by a sense of uneasiness. In contrast, when our prayer life is active, the weight of burdens will be lifted from our shoulders by the mighty hand of God.
With this in mind, why would anyone choose to cease praying? The sad truth is that many of us have become so busy that we’ve failed to set aside time to spend with the Lord. Yet if we continue this style of living, we will become vulnerable and run the risk of giving in to temptation.
To avoid these difficulties, we should place a high priority upon our fellowship and communication with the Father. After all, we must be in contact with God in order to hear from Him. How else can we understand and follow His will?
If you have allowed distance to come between you and the Lord, confess this to Him today. 1 John 1:9 promises, “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us.” When you renew your prayer life, you’ll be able to experience God’s best.
