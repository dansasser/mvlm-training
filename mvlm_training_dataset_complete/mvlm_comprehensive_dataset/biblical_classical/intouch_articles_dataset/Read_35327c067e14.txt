The Believer’s Passion
Does your relationship with God seem satisfying, or do you need to be refueled?
A fire will not continue to burn strongly unless it’s stoked. Similarly, a believer’s fervor, if left untended, can diminish.
Believers can experience “cooling” for several reasons. When tragedy strikes, a person may feel that his prayers went unanswered and that God doesn’t care. If he then prays less, it’s easy to drift away from the Lord. At other times, Christians can be sidetracked by the world’s priorities. For instance, Timothy’s enthusiasm wavered because of false teaching and fear.
Drifting can be subtle and hard to detect. Six questions can help you assess whether your enthusiasm for God remains strong: Do you ...
Desire to serve God, share the gospel, and help others?
Spend time in the Word daily?
Pray, knowing that God is listening and working?
Faithfully attend church and tithe?
Experience joy, peace, and hope in Jesus?
Stand firm in your godly convictions?
If some of your answers recently changed from “yes” to “no,” your fire may be diminishing. Acknowledge this to the Lord, and ask for His help to refuel your passion.
