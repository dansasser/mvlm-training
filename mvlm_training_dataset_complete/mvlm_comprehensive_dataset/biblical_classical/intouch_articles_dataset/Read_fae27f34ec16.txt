When We Feel Helpless
When you feel trapped, call on the Lord for rescue and wait for His deliverance.
In adventure movies, we often see people trapped and helpless, frantically looking for an escape. Real life can sometimes feel that way too, and as we begin to look for a way out, our prayers become filled with requests for deliverance—in the form of physical healing, changed circumstances, or additional provision.
Did you ever consider that even more important than physical rescue is spiritual liberation? (See Ephesians 6:12.) First and foremost, Jesus Christ delivered us from the power and penalty of sin. He knows we’re helpless in the face of sinful habits, uncontrolled emotions, and ungodly thoughts. He wants to free us from these sins.
May we follow the example of the psalmist, who encouraged crying out to God for rescue (Ps. 50:15). Admit your helplessness to Him and to yourself. Confess any fears, self-reliance, or unbelief in your life. Then turn your gaze toward the Lord.
Let the Holy Spirit fill your spirit with the truth of Scripture. Meditate on it and commit yourself to following His way. Then trust God and wait on Him to change you from the inside out. A day will come when the helpless feeling is replaced by the joy of being free. When it does, give God the glory.
