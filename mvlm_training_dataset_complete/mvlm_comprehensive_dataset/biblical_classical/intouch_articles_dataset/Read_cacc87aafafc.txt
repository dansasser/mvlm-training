To be able to see our best option, we sometimes need to wait.
We all know the phrase “You reap what you sow,” but did you know it’s actually a biblical principle? (See Job 4:8 and Proverbs 11:18.) In today’s passage, Esau learned this truth the hard way. Famished, he returned from hunting and requested some of the stew his brother made. Seizing upon the opportunity, Jacob agreed in exchange for his twin’s birthright.
In Old Testament times, the firstborn enjoyed special privileges, which included authority over younger siblings, a double share of the inheritance, and being the spiritual leader of the family. Yet Esau, deciding that food was more of a necessity, traded his birthright for dinner. He later grieved when he realized what was lost, but at that point, it was too late.
Like Esau, we all face critical choices. And though God forgives, the consequences remain. So we must learn how to choose wisely. We should take to heart two warnings from this story. First, to be able to determine our best options, we should wait until we’re physically, emotionally, and spiritually stable.
Second, it’s often important to delay gratification. Though our human desires feel overwhelming at times, we should prayerfully wait for God’s timing.
Think about the longings that you have. Pray for wisdom and patience so that you can make godly decisions during critical moments.
