We will be blessed if we listen when God instructs us to stop striving and wait.
In the season of upheaval described in today’s reading, God clearly specified how the people of Israel could be saved from their enemy. They were under threat from Assyria, and God said to wait on His ultimate deliverance instead of trying quick fixes like running to Egypt for protection. Repentance, rest, quietness, and trust were His gracious prescriptions for those awaiting restoration.
Tragically, the Israelites “would have none of it” (v. 15 NIV). Some fled on horses only to meet with disaster—a stark reminder that relying on our own efforts can easily fail us. So how can we learn to accept God’s invitation to trust and rest when we’re tempted to take matters into our own hands?
This is our hope: No matter how bleak our circumstances seem, God is our constant source of security—our “very ready help in trouble” (Psalm 46:1). It is our confidence in His character and constancy that enables us to experience peace, even when chaos surrounds us. We serve a gracious and just God who longs to pour out compassion and deliver us. Our choice to rest is a profound act of trust. Indeed, “blessed are all who wait for him” (Isa. 30:18 NIV).
