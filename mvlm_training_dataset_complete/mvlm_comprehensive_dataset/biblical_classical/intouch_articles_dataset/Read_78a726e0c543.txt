In His wisdom, God allows and uses the suffering of this world for our good.
1 Corinthians 13:9-12
1 Corinthians 13:9-12
God is good, and He’s in control of everything. But that does not mean bad things won’t happen. Thankfully, trials often drive people to the Lord. And for those of us who are already His followers, God uses difficult circumstances to mature our faith and conform us to His image.
In His omniscience and wisdom, God will allow trials to touch our life so we can grow from the experience. Growth—whether in compassion, trust, or knowledge—is good. If we could peek behind the scenes of our circumstances, we’d see the Lord sovereignly working toward His ultimate purpose.
Romans 8:28 affirms this: “God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.” On occasion, we see immediate positive results from trials. But other times, we must wait months or years (or until heaven) to fully understand what God was doing.
Suffering and evil are inevitable parts of a fallen world. But we have assurance that the Lord is in control of the universe, including the tiny corner we occupy. When He permits bad things to happen, we can be sure that He will continue to provide comfort and guidance as He shapes us into the people He wants us to be.
