Learning to Pray With Confidence
When we seek to live according to God's will, we can trust that He hears and is going to answer our prayers.
Prayer is the Christian’s most powerful means of effecting change. Yet we’re often unsure or hesitant about our appeals to the Lord.
But we should have confidence in prayer, first of all because we belong to God’s family. When we place our trust in Jesus, God becomes our heavenly Father. Because of this, we can be sure He will hear our prayers.
A second reason for assurance is that we’re praying according to God’s will. This idea often seems perplexing, so let’s take a closer look. Certain things are never in God’s plan, such as lying, cheating, or actions prompted by pride, anger, or jealousy. (See Proverbs 6:16-19; Colossians 3:8.) Insignificant matters—such as which colors we wear—are left to our discretion. But what about desires that fall in neither category? In those situations, for us to know God’s will ...
Our spirit must be submitted to Him (James 4:7-8).
We must study the Scriptures, where God’s general will is revealed through commands and principles.
We must depend on the Holy Spirit to help us pray in agreement with the Lord’s purposes (Romans 8:26).
Align your prayers with God’s will and remember He wants to say “yes” to His children.
