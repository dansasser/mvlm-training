The Lord sent the Holy Spirit to help His children live abundant, meaningful lives.
Our heavenly Father desires that we grow from spiritual infancy to maturity (1 Peter 2:2-3). Yesterday, we talked about the discipline of listening to God. Today, let’s look at several more practices necessary for living a life of faith in Christ:
God desires that we obey Him. Some of His teachings are easy to follow, while others are difficult. Choosing our own way might feel good at first, but the end result is always regret. On the other hand, every act of obedience builds faith.
God teaches us to depend on Him. At times, He may call us to something that seems impossible. But when our own strength or ability is inadequate to achieve what He requires, we learn to rely on His almighty power.
God wants us to wait on Him. We’d prefer everything to happen according to our preferences and timetable. But the Lord’s way is best, and He desires for us to trust Him and be patient.
Scripture teaches us to confess sin, repent, and learn from our missteps. And while God doesn’t expect perfection, He does want us to continually seek His presence. Our loving Father longs for every believer to have an abundant, meaningful life in Him. For this reason, He sent His Holy Spirit to indwell, equip, and empower His beloved children to reach their God-given potential.
