The Grace to Keep Going
Through our weaknesses, we can discover God's all-sufficient power and love.
2 Corinthians 12:7-10
2 Corinthians 11:22-28
2 Corinthians 12:7-10
When you listen to someone speak, what gives his or her words weight? Most often, we measure a message against the person’s experience and dismiss the thoughts and ideas that don’t seem genuine. So, when we come to Paul’s discussion of God’s sufficiency, we ask, “Is this something he can really talk about?” And we are able to read the Word and see from the apostle’s life that the answer is a resounding yes.
Paul’s testimony contains accounts of many hardships that confronted him (2 Corinthians 11:22-28). He was imprisoned, beaten, threatened, stoned, shipwrecked, and robbed. On top of all this, he had a persistent, unrelenting “thorn” (12:7-8).
You’d think God would keep His servants in perfect condition and health. Yet, when the apostle prayed for relief, God’s answer was not what he expected: “My grace is sufficient for you” (v. 9). The Lord taught Paul the lesson that in God’s hands, our weakness allows for His strength to be made even more apparent. And it is through God’s power—and His power alone—that we can do amazing things.
Perhaps you struggle with your own “thorn.” Ask God what He wants to accomplish through your weakness. It may be the vessel through which God displays His power to the world.
