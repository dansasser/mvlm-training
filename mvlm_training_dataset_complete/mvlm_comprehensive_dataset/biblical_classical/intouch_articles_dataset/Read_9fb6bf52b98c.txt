The Privilege of Knowing Christ
Knowing Jesus intimately is the most rewarding pursuit in life.
Have you ever written a résumé? It requires a good deal of skill and tact. After all, it’s the way you introduce yourself to a potential boss. You must feature your skills and accomplishments in a way that isn’t boastful. That’s quite a tall order!
The apostle Paul would have had an impressive résumé (if such a thing had existed in the first century). With regard to religious achievements, his were certainly impressive. He referred to himself as “a Hebrew of Hebrews,” “a Pharisee,” “a persecutor of the church” and “blameless” under the Law (Phil. 3:4-6). In other words, when it came to his standing in Jewish culture, Paul was a man almost without equal.
But all that changed on the road to Damascus.
After he met the Savior, Paul did a one-eighty regarding his accomplishments. “I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord,” he wrote to the church at Philippi. Every superlative became “mere rubbish” to him, compared to being found in Christ (v. 8). All those fancy titles and honors were cast aside without a moment’s regret. May we all say the same.
