Mutual love, respect, and commitment are the foundation of genuine friendship.
How many true friends do you have? Does the question bring a lot of names to mind? Or only a few? The reality is, most of us don’t have many genuine friends—ones who remain loyal no matter what.
This dependable, intimate closeness is what God wants for us, but it’s a rare treasure. Let’s look at the biblical account of David and Jonathan (1 Samuel 18:1-30; 1 Samuel 19:1-24; 1 Samuel 20:1-42). Their story demonstrates that genuine friendships are built on a foundation of mutual respect, love, and commitment. Today, let’s explore the first component.
True companionship starts by valuing all people, knowing they were lovingly created in God’s image. After all, if Jesus chose to die in their place even before any of them acknowledged Him as Savior (Romans 5:8), they must certainly have great worth. But at the same time, the high regard that David and Jonathan had for one another was greater than mere respect; it revealed admiration for the godly qualities that Scripture commends.
Consider the question asked earlier—about the people you think of as “true friends.” Do they exhibit godly attributes that you respect? And do they, in turn, admire the righteous characteristics they see in you? This mutual, scriptural respect is a necessary foundation for lasting friendship.
