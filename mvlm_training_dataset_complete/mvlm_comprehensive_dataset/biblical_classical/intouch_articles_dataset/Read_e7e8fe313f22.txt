Willing to Wait for God’s Way
Trust the Lord to bring you His best at the right time.
Many of us struggle when it comes to disciplining ourselves in the area of instant gratification. There are so many things we want now. And to make matters worse, we usually have the ability to follow through on our desires. That’s what the credit card industry is all about: Have it now; pay later. But finances aren’t the only area where we get into trouble. Being in a hurry to get married can lead to an unwise choice of a spouse. Or being in a rush for career success might tempt us not to consider whether our pursuit aligns with God’s plans.
Why do you think the Lord wants us to wait? One reason is to protect us from our own self-destructive ways. Those who can’t say no to their own desires end up enslaved to them. God wants us to be mature believers who have the character and self-restraint to wait for Him to provide in His perfect time. Because the heavenly Father is omniscient, He alone knows what’s best. You can trust that if He asks you to wait, He has something more wonderful in mind than you could ever provide for yourself.
Does anything seem to have power over you? If so, it may be an area that requires the practice of self-restraint. Yield to the Lord and submit your desires to Him. Then, begin saying no to temptations as you wait for God to reveal His perfect plan.
