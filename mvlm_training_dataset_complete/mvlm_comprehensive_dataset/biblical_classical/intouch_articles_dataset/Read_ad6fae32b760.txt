In seasons of suffering, draw close to God for comfort and the answers you need.
Is it possible to draw closer to the Father through our doubts? The life of Job suggests an answer. Verse 15 of today’s passage is key to understanding his mindset: “Though He slay me, I will hope in Him.” No matter what happened, Job was determined to keep hoping and trusting in God, even while struggling to understand why he suffered. Both hoping and questioning can be expressions of faith.
Knowing that the Lord was the only one who could answer him, Job wanted an opportunity to pose his questions. Then, in chapters 38-41, the Lord responded, leaving His servant both humbled and astonished (Job 42:2-6).
In seasons of suffering, we, too, may have questions for God, such as “What have I done wrong?” “Why are You treating me this way?” and “Don’t You see my brokenness?” When that happens, we can be comforted to know we’re in good company. In fact, Jesus Himself faithfully inquired of God. From the cross, our Savior asked, “My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?” (Matthew 27:46).
And how will God respond when we have earnest questions for Him? He’ll keep us close and—in His infinite, awe-inspiring love and mercy—carry us through.
