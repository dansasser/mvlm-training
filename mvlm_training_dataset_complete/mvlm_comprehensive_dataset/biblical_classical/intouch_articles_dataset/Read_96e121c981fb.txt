How to Serve the Body of Christ
Our kindness to others can start a chain reaction that impacts many for Christ.
1 Corinthians 12:14-26
1 Corinthians 12:14-26
When we talk about serving the church with talents and gifts, what comes to mind—a choir singer? Sunday school teacher? The truth is, there are many different ways to use our talents.
Church isn’t a “Sunday only” establishment. It’s not simply a place and time; it is a body of believers, each one gifted by God to guide, help, and support the rest. In fact, service to the Lord doesn’t have to take place within church. It can happen out in the world as well (Matthew 5:16).
The majority of believers aren’t in a position to influence large crowds. When we act or speak, it’s usually only those closest to us who notice, but a chain reaction ripples outward to affect others. Paul’s metaphor of body parts working together is a helpful description of how one small action can have widespread impact (1 Cor. 12:15-21). Consider the way your big toe keeps your foot stable, thereby steadying your whole body. In the same way, a gentle rebuke, a listening ear, or a loving deed benefits the church by strengthening someone, who then supports another …
We are on this earth to serve God’s kingdom and His church. And we do that by ministering to each other in small ways that steady the whole body as we give extra support to one member. This week, look for a need that God can meet through you.
