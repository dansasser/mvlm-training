We will never exhaust the abundant blessings that are ours because of Jesus.
In the gospel of Matthew, Jesus tells the story of a man who found a treasure hidden in a field. Apparently, no one else knew of its existence, so he covered it and sold all he had in order to secure the new property (Matthew 13:44).
As believers, we have inherited a vast treasure called the grace of God. For years, its great worth may remain somewhat hidden from our view, but as we seek out its true valuation, we are astonished to find how wealthy we are. This is what John was getting at when he exclaimed, “For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace” (John 1:16). Another translation of that verse puts it like this: “From his abundance we have all received one gracious blessing after another” (NLT).
Paul describes these successive blessings in Colossians 1: We can be filled with the knowledge of God’s will “in all spiritual wisdom and understanding”—then we’ll be able to please the Lord in “all respects” and bear fruit in “every good work.” What’s more, we will be strengthened with “all power” and thereby be able to attain “all perseverance and patience” (vv. 9-11). Indeed, the Lord has an abundance of goodness and blessings for His children. Let’s stop to thank Him for endowing us with “grace upon grace.”
