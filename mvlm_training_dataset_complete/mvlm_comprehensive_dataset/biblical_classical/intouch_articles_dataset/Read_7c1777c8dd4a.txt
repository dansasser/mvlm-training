From Emptiness to Fulfillment
Jesus came to give us abundant life; ask Him to help you experience it.
As we saw in yesterday’s devotion, everyone feels a sense of emptiness, a yearning for something—for someone. That someone is God Himself. Today’s passage about the Samaritan woman teaches several important points about fulfillment.
Filling our emptiness is important to God. Jewish people didn’t travel through Samaria because of their disdain for its inhabitants. Yet Jesus, a Jew, chose to travel there because He knew a hurting Samaritan was ready to hear about the Father’s love.
Our attempts at happiness often leave us feeling hopeless. The woman at the well had been wed five times, but all her marriages had ended. Each one likely left her feeling lonelier than before.
God knows our pain. When the woman admitted she didn’t currently have a husband, Jesus showed that He already knew her situation. He demonstrated an awareness of her hurt and longing.
Jesus can satisfy our yearnings. Once the woman realized what was missing, Jesus revealed how to live a full life: “Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never be thirsty” (vv. 13-14).
Do you ever feel like the Samaritan woman—dissatisfied with life and thirsty for love and fulfillment? Surrender to God and allow His love to flow through you. Only then will you experience truly abundant life.
