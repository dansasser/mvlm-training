We miss God's best when we choose to compromise our integrity.
We often don’t realize how important something is until it’s not there. For example, we may not think much of a light bulb until we’re fumbling in the dark. Similarly, to appreciate how much truth matters, consider the impact of its absence.
When our faith isn’t grounded in truth, we ...
Become vulnerable to wrong teaching.
Develop habits that don’t align with God’s will, because we don’t know what it is.
Can stay trapped in emotional bondage.
Experience continual disappointment because our peace is gone.
Can’t grow spiritually.
All relationships require honesty. If we develop a reputation for not telling the truth, our friendships and testimony will be damaged. Not only that, but our self-image will also suffer. And unless we repent, we won’t reach our full potential. This isn’t how God wants us to live—He wants so much more for us.
Today’s passage tells us “to put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth” (v. 24). He made us for a purpose (Jeremiah 29:11) and wants us to live in truth so we can walk with Him, enjoying all the blessings He has in store for us.
