At salvation, we become a member of God's family and receive eternal life, freedom, and love.
Paul wrote and spoke extensively about grace—God’s favor given to the undeserving. The apostle knew firsthand the freedom that Christ gives. He described himself as the worst of sinners (1 Timothy 1:15) because he persecuted many believers prior to his conversion.
Once we accept Christ’s death on our behalf, we’re reconciled to God, and sin’s power over us is broken. The Holy Spirit indwells us, and we become spiritually alive. We’re given a new family and purpose for living. Scripture likens our conversion experience to receiving a heart transplant (Ezekiel 36:26), changing citizenship (Philippians 3:20), and moving from darkness to the kingdom of light (Colossians 1:13).
Our Father’s desire and will is that we relate to Him on the basis of grace alone (Ephesians 2:8). Just as we needed to rely on Christ’s gift for salvation, we are to live a life of dependence upon Him. It’s our faith, expressed through obedience, that pleases God (Hebrews 11:6).
Grace is the most powerful, life-changing force in the world. God the Father freely offers His unconditional love to whoever receives His Son. At salvation, our life is placed upon the immovable Rock—Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 10:4)—whose favor is extended to us.
