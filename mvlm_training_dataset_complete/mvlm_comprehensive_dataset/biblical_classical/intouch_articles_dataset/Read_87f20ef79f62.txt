To find a deeper, more satisfying relationship with the Lord, be a doer of the Word.
James 1:22 says, “But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not just hearers who deceive themselves.” This verse teaches us the importance of intentionality in our journey of faith. As Christians, we’re offered an abundance of information, such as sermons, books, podcasts, and conferences, to help us grow in our faith. Yet it’s in the doing—in other words, in our intentional response—that our faith truly comes alive.
Just as we might deliberately plant and nurture a seed to bear fruit, our faith requires purposeful action. Hearing the Word is the beginning, but living it out is the practice of our Christian walk. When we knowingly apply God’s truths to our life, we become a vessel of His love and grace to those around us. This involves asking ourselves how we can embody God’s Word through our actions. After all, it’s through demonstrations of thoughtfulness, forgiveness, and love that we bear witness to our faith.
So, as you go about your day, consider ways to purposefully live out your faith. Small acts of kindness, words of encouragement, and moments of prayer can have a profound impact. And the more such things become your goal, the more you’ll experience intimacy in your relationship with God.
