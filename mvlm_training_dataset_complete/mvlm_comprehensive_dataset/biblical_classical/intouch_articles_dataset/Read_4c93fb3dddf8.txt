The Truth About Salvation
The free gift of salvation is available to everyone—and it comes only through Jesus.
Have you ever wondered if faith in Jesus is really the only way to be saved? It’s an important question—and thankfully one with a clear answer.
The truth is, God gave us free will so we can choose to accept or reject the salvation that Jesus Christ offers. Though He desires for all to be saved, the Lord will never compel us to believe. Scripture tells us, “God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him. He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God” (John 3:17-18).
Verse 16 clearly states that whoever believes in the Son will be saved. This means you can be sure of your salvation by asking Jesus to be your personal Savior. God, who wants you to spend eternity with Him, offers a compelling reason to make this all-important decision: “He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life” (John 3:36).
The free gift of salvation is available to everyone—and it comes to us only through Jesus (John 14:6). Receive Him now, and you will never have to wonder what awaits you in eternity.
