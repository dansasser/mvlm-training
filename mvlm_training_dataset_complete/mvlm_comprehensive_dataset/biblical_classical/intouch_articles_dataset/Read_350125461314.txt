The Hope of Jesus’ Return
The death of fellow believers may cause temporary grief, but we can look forward to the joy of a heavenly reunion.
1 Thessalonians 4:13-18
1 Thessalonians 4:13-18
Throughout history, people have wondered what happens after death. Let’s turn to God’s Word to see what He says.
In today’s verses, Paul explains what will happen at Christ’s return—both to the saints who have died and to those still living. First, Jesus will descend from the sky in a way similar to His ascension. (See Acts 1:11.) Then, God will resurrect the bodies of departed believers. (We know from 2 Corinthians 5:8 that their spirits will have been with Jesus since the moment of physical death.) Next, Christians who are still alive will rise to meet Jesus in the air and will dwell with Him forever.
While we should strive to glorify the Lord every moment we’re alive, it is important to be aware of these future events. The reason is found in 1 Thessalonians 4:13: “So that you will not grieve as do the rest who have no hope.” In fact, verse 18 tells us to comfort each other with the understanding of what will happen when Jesus returns.
What a loving heavenly Father! He gives us such hope, comfort, and strength to endure life’s hardships. Read today’s Scripture passage again—but this time, in place of the words “those who have fallen asleep,” substitute the name of a departed Christian you love—and bask in the hope that the Father has given.
