Discovering God’s Will
The Lord is actively working to create something beautiful with our life.
God wants His children to obey Him and make right decisions, so He accepts full responsibility for guiding us. In fact, He promises, “I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you should go” (Psalm 32:8). However, our lifetime isn’t mapped out in an instruction manual to read in its entirety the day we’re saved. Following God’s will is a daily process of trust.
We learn God’s will by reading His Word. There we find rules and commands that will lead to our success and principles for daily application. The Bible doesn’t detail every possible situation we might face, but its principles equip us to make decisions about any and every circumstance we encounter. Studying God’s Word is the only way for a believer to recognize His will. Today’s passage says the sacred writings can give us the wisdom we need in order to be fully capable and equipped for the work God wants us to accomplish (vv. 15, 17).
Our heavenly Father is actively guiding every incident of our life, stitching the seemingly unrelated “threads” together to create something beautiful. As believers, we must be listening so we can discern when He’s revealing His will. Pray every day that He’ll make you sensitive to His ways.
