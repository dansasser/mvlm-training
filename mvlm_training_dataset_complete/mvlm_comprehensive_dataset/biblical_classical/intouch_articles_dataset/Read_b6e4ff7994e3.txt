Nothing we do for the Lord should take precedence over spending time with Him.
Jesus loved Martha, Mary, and Lazarus (John 11:5), and today’s passage tells of a time when He and the disciples visited this family.  Extending hospitality no doubt involved a lot of preparation. Martha, however, in all her busyness, lost sight of the importance of spending time with Jesus.
But let’s not be quick to judge her. As Jesus’ followers, we know that He is to have first place above all else in life. Thoughts, attitudes, and actions are to flow out of our relationship with Him. Yet, as we’ve all no doubt discovered, this isn’t always easy to do.
When Jesus arrived, Mary stopped what she was doing so she could listen to His words and learn from Him. Martha, distracted by all that was still to be done, kept working. The Lord affirmed Mary’s choice to be with Him and urged Martha to follow her sister’s example. Both women expressed their love and care for Jesus through their actions, but Mary chose the better way.
Nothing should supersede our relationship with the Lord; our character and conduct should reflect Christlikeness (Ephesians 4:24). During Jesus’ visit, Martha—with the best of intentions—let her service become more important than time with Him. May we not lose focus, even in the busiest seasons of our life.
