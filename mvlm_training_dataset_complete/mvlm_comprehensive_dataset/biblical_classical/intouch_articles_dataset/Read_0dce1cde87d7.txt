To Be Established in Love
Jesus made it possible for us to understand how precious we are to our heavenly Father.
When it comes to stability, everything depends on the supporting substructure. Most trees extend their roots two or three times as wide as their foliage. And the tallest skyscraper in the world has a foundation that goes down over 160 feet.
The root—or foundation—of the Christian life is God’s love. His love is what makes our love possible, and it became knowable in Jesus Christ.
In today’s passage, this is what Paul has in mind as he brings his prayer to a close. He asks that the Ephesians—empowered by the Spirit and encouraged by Christ’s indwelling presence—would base themselves in love. He also prays that their understanding of God’s love would grow together “with all the saints” who have believed and entrusted themselves to Jesus (v. 18).
This love of Christ is a boundless ocean deep enough to drown all our sins (Micah 7:19). Though it is “too great to understand fully,” Paul wants the Christians at Ephesus—and us—to have the power to grasp “the width and length and height and depth” of this great foundation (Eph. 3:18-19 NLT) so we can rest secure. Then we can pray without ceasing that countless more believers be added to our number.
