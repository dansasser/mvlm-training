Aligning Our Desires With God’s
Getting what we want doesn't always bring the happiness we thought it would.
Having desires is good—they often set the direction for our life. But unless our objectives match God’s, the longings we have are likely to prove empty and disappointing. (See John 4:7-14.) So how can we be sure our goals align with the Lord’s?
One way is through reading Scripture, which reveals God’s values. However, many things we yearn for are not specifically addressed in the Bible as “thou shalt” or “thou shalt not.” Thankfully, believers have access to God’s wisdom and discernment through His Holy Spirit, who Jesus promised would counsel us (John 14:26).
Another way to evaluate our desires is through honest prayer. In today’s psalm, David says, “The Lord is near to all who call on Him, to all who call on Him in truth. He will fulfill the desire of those who fear Him” (vv. 18-19). When we authentically share our heart with God, He will respond with the guidance we need.
Ultimately, genuine love and respect for God ensures that we’re following His lead. If you don’t have this kind of connection with God, take a moment to ask Him for help.
