Spend time in the Word to discover who God is and how He operates.
If we believe God is who He says He is and will do what He has promised, why do so many of us habitually waver in our prayers? Instead of exercising bold faith, we come to God hoping He will hear us and answer our requests.
Perhaps one reason we are so prone to doubt is that we fail to discern God at work in our circumstances. We asked, and it seems as if nothing has happened. But the Lord sees the past, present, and future and knows the right time for every answer. His invisible hand is already at work on our behalf—arranging situations, opening hearts, and preparing us to receive what He wants to give.
Another cause for uncertainty may be that we don’t adequately know God’s ways. Then His response might disappoint us. Our prayers are often accompanied by expectations of how He’ll work. So when He fails to intervene according to the method we anticipate, doubt can set in. But knowing God and trusting in His perfect ways will give us stability as we wait for His answer.
To overcome doubts, spend time in the Word to learn God’s principles and ways. Then you’ll begin to grasp what He wants to achieve in your life and how He goes about it. Examine your past from a biblical perspective—faith will grow as you see the unexpected ways He’s answered your prayers.
