Stop for a moment to praise the Lord for His faithfulness and endless mercy.
It’s amazing how death and life occur so close together. It’s said that dawn comes just after the darkest hour of night. And just when we suspect we cannot survive another moment of winter’s dormancy and darkness, spring arrives.
It comes as just a hint, a whisper. A tinge of green too small to see—and yet somehow, we perceive that the once barren forest is not entirely lifeless anymore. Soon birdsong wakes us in the morning, and flower buds peek through the ground. Where once there was only last year’s death, suddenly new life bursts through.
It is the Lord who holds the keys to this mystery—the Creator who sings the song that turns the earth toward another year of life. And through it all, we learn to see, to trust, to know that the God whose faithfulness is vividly present in spring has never left us, not even during the darkest moments of winter.
The Creator who planted the first garden in Genesis, who will plant the Tree of Healing in Revelation, delivers showers of spring rain to us today—bringing the earth back to life. Bringing us back to life. As this month ends, let us pray together: Giver of Life, You have never left our side. We look to You now with gratitude and worship.
