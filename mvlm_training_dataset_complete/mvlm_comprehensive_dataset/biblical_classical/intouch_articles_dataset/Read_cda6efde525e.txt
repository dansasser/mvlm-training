Our Trials: Allowed by God
The Lord never permits hardship unless He has a beautiful purpose.
Some people have the wrong idea about the Christian life. Once they become believers, they expect everything to be smooth sailing. Yet Jesus made it clear that troubles are inevitable, even for God’s children (John 16:33). His own life was no exception.
So, even as His followers, we can expect difficulty, though the causes of tribulation differ with each circumstance. Some problems arise from the fallen nature of the world, while others result from ignorance, sin, or poor decisions. There’s also another possibility—sometimes God Himself allows trials. While this last option is hard to accept during painful times, we should remember the Lord never permits hardship unless He has a beautiful purpose for it. And He promises to give us strength to endure.
That’s why, when we encounter struggles, it’s important for us to keep in mind that they can be for our benefit. Perhaps they are intended to purify and grow us. Maybe God’s purpose is to test our endurance and devotion, strengthening our trust. Or He might be revealing His sustaining power. This side of heaven, we may never know the cause, but we can trust the Lord’s character and ability to deliver us.
What trials are you facing? Jesus understands your pain and longs to be the One you cling to in both good times and bad.
