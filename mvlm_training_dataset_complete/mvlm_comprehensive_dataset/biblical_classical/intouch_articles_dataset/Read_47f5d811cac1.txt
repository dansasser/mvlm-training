Our Personal Accountability
Ask the Lord to help you find a godly friend who will love, encourage, and challenge you.
Being involved in an accountability relationship is one of life’s greatest gifts. Consider some of the excellent examples from Scripture: Jesus is accountable to the Father (John 8:28-29), the church is subject to Christ (Ephesians 5:24), and Paul felt beholden to the church at Antioch (Acts 14:27). When we have someone with whom we can share our failures, weaknesses, successes, and longings, we benefit in several important ways.
For one thing, accountability helps us develop a sense of responsibility. It also promotes integrity and protects us from making poor decisions. What’s more, learning to examine ourselves keeps us honest and humble.
Because an accountability partner can see our weaknesses, he or she is in a good position to offer counsel, encouragement, or a loving rebuke. To choose the right person, we must look for a Spirit-filled believer who will offer godly wisdom. Also, we want to be accountable to a person who accepts and loves us just as we are but who also possesses the courage to confront us.
So, where will you find such a person? Possibly in the pew at church or among your friend group. Begin to pray today for an accountability partner, and ask God to help you become one yourself.
