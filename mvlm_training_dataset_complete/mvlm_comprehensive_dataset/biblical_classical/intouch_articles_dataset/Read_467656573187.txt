Dealing With Loneliness
When you are lonely, ask the Lord to remind you of His love and care.
How should we respond when we’re in dire need of companionship? Turning to the Lord can help us find our way through the dark cloud of loneliness. We can ...
Admit lonely feelings. Being a Christian doesn’t mean we won’t ever feel alone. In fact, many of David’s psalms speak of his longing for companionship. When we cry out to the Father and express our feelings, He will answer (Psalm 91:15). Ask the Lord to wrap His arms around you. His response is just as real as the loving embrace of a fellow human being.
Develop godly relationships. We should pray to have friends who will point us toward the Lord whether we’re in good times or bad. These are loved ones who see our faults but love us anyway.
Be anchored in Scripture. When we cling to biblical truth during a lonely time, we will end up with a richer understanding of the Lord. Immerse yourself in God’s Word and memorize His promises.
Occasionally we all will walk through the fog of loneliness. But God is the Light guiding us out again. If you are struggling with feelings of isolation, cry out to Him for help.
