If you are in a season of waiting, don't become discouraged—the Lord always delivers.
Sometimes it can be hard to grasp how much time passed between events in the Bible. After the Old Testament’s completion, for instance, 400 years passed before God’s next direct revelation.
Let’s put that span in terms we can better comprehend. In 1620, the Pilgrims landed on the shores of what would become Massachusetts. That was 404 years ago. Think of all that has happened since then—everything from the American Revolution to man walking on the moon to the creation of artificial intelligence. God’s people waited that long without a word from the Lord! While many grew despondent, others clung to hope.
Anna, for example, was a widow and prophetess who served at the temple in Jerusalem, waiting for Israel’s redemption. She trusted that “A shoot will spring from the stem of Jesse ... and the Spirit of the Lord will rest on Him” (Isa. 11:1-2). This promised Messiah would bring order, strength, counsel, and wisdom as He delighted in the Lord, and He would make everything right.
Then, at the appointed time, Anna witnessed the miracle of fulfilled prophecy as she gazed into the face of the tiny baby Jesus. In response, she praised and thanked God for being faithful to His promise (Luke 2:38). Like her, we can praise God, secure in the knowledge that God will do all He says He will do.
