The Promise of Eternal Life
When we trust Jesus as our Savior, we receive the gift of eternal life.
Our culture is fascinated by longevity. While the desire for a long, fulfilling life is natural, God’s Word encourages us to remember that our earthly existence is not all there is.
No pill or diet can extend our days here beyond the number God has willed. But we can live forever in a perfect home, doing soul-satisfying work. When we believe Jesus is God’s Son and trust Him as our Savior, we receive the gift of eternal life.
Although we’re promised a place in heaven, the life we experience now or later isn’t primarily about location. The true value is that we are and always will be in the presence of God. We will be fully healed and forever home with the One who loves us beyond anything we can imagine.
First John 5:1 tells us, “Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God.” Verse 12 expands on that thought: “He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.” It is through Him that we have God’s promise of eternity (Romans 6:23).
Reaching a healthy old age is a laudable goal, but nothing’s more important than receiving the Savior and enjoying what is to come—the gift of living forever in His presence.
