The Reward of Letting Go
We may not always understand God's plans, but if we choose to trust Him, blessing will follow.
We won’t always understand how God is going to accomplish His plans. All He asks is that we surrender our will to His and trust that He’ll show us the way (Proverbs 3:5-6). Abraham’s willingness to give up what was most precious to him came from his unyielding faith in the Lord’s trustworthiness.
However, if you tell God no because He won’t explain why He wants you to do something, you actually hinder His blessing. But when you say yes to the Lord, He will pour out His goodness and reward your obedience. What matters more than material blessings are the things He is teaching us in our spirit. Obeying the Lord naturally positions us to receive what He’s already trying to give us. But when we fail to trust Him and refuse to do what He says, we’re the ones choosing to close ourselves off from some of the good God would have accomplished in our life.
What has the Lord told you to do? Have you only partially cooperated? Or have you, like Abraham, given up your need to understand and obeyed completely?
If God says to give more than you think you’re able to part with, know that He will provide. Whether things are running smoothly or the bottom has dropped out, He is always trustworthy.
