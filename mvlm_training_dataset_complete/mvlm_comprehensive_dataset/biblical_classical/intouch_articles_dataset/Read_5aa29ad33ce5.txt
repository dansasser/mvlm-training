Are you living with the freedom and love Jesus offers?
Guilt over doing something that violates the conscience is reasonable. However, living under a cloud of remorse for no reason isn’t. God designed guilt to serve as a reminder that we’ve sinned and need to repent. But Satan twists those emotions to imprison us— that’s why people living in shame often feel unsure of God’s love.
Good guilt—the Lord’s tool for prompting repentance—is a gift that helps us find the right path. However, the Devil encourages false guilt, which leads us to feel responsible for things outside our control. This unhealthy type of guilt is a widespread problem for those in legalistic churches or lifestyles—certain behaviors or thoughts are labeled as wrong, and then people feel ashamed for doing or thinking those things.
Self-condemnation stunts a relationship with Jesus by keeping us from authentic, satisfying experiences with Him. Instead of enjoying His peace, those trapped by shame fear His rejection and feel driven to prove their worth. Trust is nearly impossible because they are waiting for God’s judgment to rain down.
Jesus did not come to condemn us (Romans 8:1). He restored our souls and made us righteous before God so that our guilt is removed, and He wants nothing more than to take your shame away. Surrender it to Jesus today, and He will give you freedom.
