Accountable to the Father
Because God is perfect in love and wisdom, we can fully trust that His boundaries are for our good.
Those of us who are parents have a great responsibility to teach and train our children in the way they should go. We have been given authority over them for their protection and benefit. We make sure they brush their teeth, eat their vegetables, do their homework, and say their prayers. We teach them to be respectful, patient, and kind. We train them to know and do the right thing in difficult situations (Proverbs 22:6). While all of this is important, there’s one principle we must teach that surpasses all the rest: They are ultimately accountable not to us but to the living God—His authority in their life is higher than ours will ever be.
One day, our children won’t have to answer to us anymore. So it’s essential that they learn God loves them more than we ever could—and that they’re accountable to Him for everything they do (including behavior, words, and choice of friends). Then our kids will be more likely to continue following Him and His ways even when no longer under our watchful eyes. Their obedience to the Lord will be borne out of their relationship with Him, not based on our expectations. And they’ll recognize He’s always with them, wherever they go (Matthew 28:20). A true understanding of God’s deep love and their accountability to Him will shape our children’s relationship with Him and the ultimate direction of their life.
