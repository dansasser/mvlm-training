One day Jesus will return to take us to our eternal home in heaven.
During our life, most of us will have opportunities to experience amazing things, see beautiful views, and hear wonderful music. But more marvelous than any earthly event is what Christians will experience at the return of Christ. Just imagine…
• What we will hear. Jesus “will descend from heaven with a shout” (1 Thessalonians 4:16). The voice of the archangel Michael—the leader of the angelic host—and a heavenly trumpet will be heard, calling the saints to assemble.
• What we will see. As described yesterday, the Lord will come down from above, to be met in the air by newly resurrected saints and then, a moment later, by living believers.
• What we will feel. Though it’s impossible to know exactly what the experience will be like, we can expect it to be magnificent. We’ll be transformed physically: Unlike our present body, our new form won’t be susceptible to pain, sin, sadness, sickness, or death. And in an instant, we will be brought into the presence of our heavenly Father, to remain with Him for eternity.
Let’s encourage one another—and ourselves—with this reminder about Jesus Christ’s return (1 Thessalonians 4:18). So when hardships get you down, think about this exciting event in your future. The best is yet to come!
