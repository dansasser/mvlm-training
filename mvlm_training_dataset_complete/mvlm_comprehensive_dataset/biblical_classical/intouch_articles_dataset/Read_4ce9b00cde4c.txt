When you feel inadequate for the task in front of you, where do you turn?
When we find ourselves in a new environment or unfamiliar situation, it’s natural to feel unsure. Even Solomon felt lost and inadequate in taking on his new role as king of Israel. He said he felt “like a little boy [who did] not know how to go out or come in” (1 Kings 3:7). Can you relate?
Maybe you’re embarking on a second career. Or perhaps you’re stepping out of your comfort zone to serve in an area of ministry you’ve never experienced. Maybe you’re a new grandparent who feels the weight of responsibility as a positive influence in your grandchild’s life. Whatever the uncharted circumstance, we each have a choice when we’re unsure what to do next: We can either lean into our own understanding and try to figure things out on our own, or we can ask God to guide us.
Solomon’s realization of his own inadequacy caused him to cry out to God for the wisdom to do his job well. And his prayer was answered. We, too, have the opportunity to turn to God for help. Next time you feel unsure of yourself or your abilities, remember to follow Solomon’s example. Ask the Lord to give you a heart of wisdom to do—with excellence—what He has called you to.
