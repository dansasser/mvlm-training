When we are firmly rooted in God's truth, we can withstand the storms of life.
Many of us are familiar with the fable of the three little pigs who each build a house—one of straw, another of sticks, and the last of bricks. A wolf “huffs and puffs” to blow their homes down and is successful with the first two. But the house of bricks stands. Does that story ring a bell?
Jesus taught the same principle. He said one man built his house on a rock while another built on sand (Matthew 7:24-27). In rain and wind, the home on the solid foundation was protected. But Jesus was teaching about obedience, not construction. The point is that life must be built on the dependability of the gospel if we’re to withstand the storms that arise.
Today’s proverb says, “Do not let kindness and truth leave you … Write them on the tablet of your heart” (v. 3). Truth should be an intrinsic part of life, as second nature as breathing. But how do we build it in? Here are five steps to take:
Evaluate the results of past failures regarding truthfulness.
Accept the Bible as the ultimate guidebook for truth.
Practice communicating with love and compassion.
Ask God to give you an ever-increasing desire for truthfulness along with ever-increasing humility.
Feast on the Word of God daily.
Remember, truth delights the Lord (Proverbs 12:22) and is a blessing for us as well.
