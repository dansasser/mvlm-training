God is beyond our comprehension—and we wouldn’t want it any other way.
While the term trinity doesn’t appear in Scripture, it’s how we describe God, who consists of three persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. They’re all eternal, omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, and immutable, but each one has a unique role.
The Father is our Creator, who called creation good. In His hands rests control of the universe and every aspect of our life. The Father oversees all circumstances so that everything can be used for our good.
The Son is our Savior. Jesus Christ became fully man while remaining fully God. He came to earth specifically to die on the cross and thereby rescue us from the consequences of our sin. Today, Jesus sits at the Father’s right hand and intercedes for us.
The Holy Spirit is our Helper, who resides within every believer, starting at the moment of salvation. From the Spirit, we receive divine wisdom, spiritual gifts, and the power to carry out the work the Father calls us to do.
Together, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit love you perfectly and meet all of your needs. No matter where you’re at in your spiritual journey today, you can turn to our triune God for love, protection, salvation, and guidance.
