Today, take time to make a list of reasons to give thanks to God.
1 Thessalonians 5:16-18
1 Thessalonians 5:16-18
In Ephesians 5:20, we’re told, “Always give thanks for everything to our God and Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ” (TLB). As this month’s Getting Started page acknowledged, that might seem easy when life’s going well. But if painful circumstances arise, expressing gratitude can be difficult.
The apostle Paul, who penned today’s passage, knew his riches in Christ Jesus far outweighed any earthly discomfort. Consider the blessings he so valued, which are available to all believers.
First of all, we are invited to have a personal relationship with the one true God—the sovereign, omniscient, and omnipresent Lord of all creation. Second, our Creator loves us with an everlasting and unconditional love. Third, He sent His Son to rescue us so we could spend eternity with Him. As a result, when we place our trust in Jesus, we are freed from the fear of death.
And the list of blessings keeps going: God adopts believers as His children and seals them with His Spirit (Ephesians 4:30). He promises to meet every need through His limitless resources (Philippians 4:19) and provides His Word and indwelling Spirit to guide us.
No wonder Paul was grateful! Review the blessings you listed yesterday, and think of any additional reasons to give thanks. As you do, be sure to count Paul’s blessings as your own.
