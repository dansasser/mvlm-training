Our Gifts for His Kingdom
God has given every believer the ability to make a difference in the world.
1 Corinthians 12:4-26
1 Corinthians 12:4-26
We know we’re supposed to serve others, but some of us just don’t know how. Or maybe we don’t feel we have the right qualities to make a difference in someone else’s life. Yet the Lord has gifted each of us in unique ways, with a purpose in mind.
Today’s passage explains this idea by using the human body as an illustration: Each person has gifts and purposes that make the entire system function well. Every part is crucial, even though some may be less noticeable than others. Paul writes, “The parts of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary; and those parts of the body which we consider less honorable, on these we bestow greatest honor … so that there may be no division in the body, but that the parts may have the same care for one another” (vv. 22-23, 25).
One person who took this communal perspective to heart was Peter. In a letter, he defined himself as “a bond-servant and apostle of Jesus Christ” (2 Peter 1:1). He was no longer a man motivated by self-interest. Once He followed Jesus, he saw himself as a servant of God. We, too, are called to serve the King of Kings—with whatever abilities we are given, whether it’s teaching, sweeping, or listening.
