A Foundation of Unwavering Faith
We can count on the everlasting love of Jesus: He will never leave us and will always help us.
In our ever-changing world, families move, friendships drift, and technology advances. If we seek security in people, possessions, or positions, we’re going to be disappointed. Yet we all need somewhere to turn during the storms of life. The true anchor for our soul is Jesus, who Scripture promises will never change. To find comfort in Him, we must learn who He is, what He does, and how He works.
John 1:1 reveals that Jesus was Deity from the beginning. Fully God and fully man, He was born of a virgin. Scripture identifies Him as the Christ (Matthew 16:16-17)—the Savior who was crucified and who rose after three days. Jesus is the Son of the Living God and the only way to Him (John 14:6). He fulfilled countless prophecies in the Old Testament, such as Isaiah 53:1-12. Like us, Jesus has feelings—He wept for hurting people and felt angry when people misused the temple. Most importantly, His resurrection defeated death, and He still lives today.
God’s character never varies. Of course, as situations change, He acts accordingly. But the merciful, loving, compassionate, and holy Jesus we know in Scripture is the same Messiah we can cling to today. Where do you turn in trying times? Difficult circumstances are inevitable. Prepare yourself for them by learning who Jesus is—He’s the only true shelter and rock that will not change.
