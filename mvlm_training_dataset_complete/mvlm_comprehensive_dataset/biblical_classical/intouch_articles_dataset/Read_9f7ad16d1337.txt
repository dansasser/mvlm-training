The Key to the Good Things in Life
The Lord delights in helping and providing for those who seek Him.
Perhaps the title of today’s devotion sounds like a self-help book promising comfort and wealth if you follow 10 easy steps. But when you consider how our culture defines the good things in life, you’ll realize that God’s definition isn’t the same—truly good things are achieved only by seeking Him. When we make God our top priority, we can expect His blessings of ...
A deep love relationship. Those who earnestly seek God learn to know Him intimately and experience an amazing sense of oneness with Him (Jeremiah 29:13).
Satisfaction. Only the Lord can fill the empty place in every heart. All earthly pursuits of pleasure or purpose fade in comparison to the satisfaction found in His presence.
Joy. Seeking God results in joy that circumstances can’t steal, since it’s based on a believer’s relationship with Christ.
Help. The Lord’s hand of favor is upon those who seek Him. He delights in coming to their aid and providing for them.
Are you experiencing these good things, or have other pursuits sidetracked you? Your thoughts reveal your priorities. If you habitually go all day without thinking of God, you’re not earnestly seeking Him. But when He’s the delight of your life, you won’t be able to forget Him.
