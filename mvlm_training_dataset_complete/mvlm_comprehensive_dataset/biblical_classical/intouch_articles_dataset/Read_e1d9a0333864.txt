Developing a Discerning Spirit
Discernment isn’t an innate quality—we must be trained by the Holy Spirit to distinguish between good and evil.
No matter how long a person has known Jesus, every faith journey ebbs and flows—with regard to doubt, intimacy, despair, joy, and more. Today’s passage discusses one such area of fluctuation: our ability to discern.
Comparing discernment to a baby’s diet, the writer of Hebrews observed that Jewish Christians at the time lacked spiritual wisdom and needed help consuming information. However, he went on to say that they could mature; they just needed to “have their senses trained to distinguish between good and evil” (v. 14). In other words, it’s possible to acquire keen discernment.
If you’re experiencing cloudy judgment right now, you can lean on two sources for guidance: God’s Word and God’s Spirit. When we listen for His Spirit and read Scripture over time, we will gradually be trained to sense the difference between what is righteous and what isn’t. Even if you face a situation that isn’t addressed in the Bible, you have a Helper whose job is to guide you into all the truth (John 14:26; 16:13).
God has given all believers access to His wisdom. So if you need guidance today, don’t hesitate to ask Him. He wants to help you.
