Go to God with your struggles—and discover His sufficiency.
“Draw near to God and He will draw near to you.” (James 4:8). What an amazing promise! As we open ourselves up to the Lord, He opens up to us. If we come to Him in submission, repentance, and brokenness, He rushes in with forgiveness, love, and faithfulness. There is no room for self-sufficiency or self-protection in this interaction. Only in the humility of helplessness will we discover not just adequacy but abundance in His presence.
At first glance, we may seem to be the ones who begin this relationship, but in reality, it is God who has taken the initiative; we are merely responding to His offer (John 6:44). Many times, He uses situations and difficulties to get our attention and draw us closer to Him. What appears to be a painful or desperate situation may actually be His invitation. Even our greatest failures and sins can lead us to Christ, as we seek forgiveness from the Father. With an attitude of humble repentance, we can enter into a more intimate relationship with God.
Have you let adversity or failure pull you away from the Lord instead of toward Him? To put distance between you and Jesus, Satan will misuse the very situations that the Lord can utilize to draw you to Himself. Don’t let the enemy win the battle. “Resist the devil and he will flee from you” (James 4:7).
