Made by God and for God
Ask your heavenly Father to help you comprehend—in both mind and heart—the depth of His love for you.
At least to some degree, most of us value appearances, whether it has to do with physical looks or an air of competence at work. As a result, it’s easy to compare ourselves with those around us and falsely conclude that we don’t measure up. But God sees things differently.
First, God made us in His image and then called what He had created “good” (Genesis 1:27; Genesis 1:31). He knitted each of us together in the womb (Ps. 139:13); no one is exactly like anyone else. We are each uniquely made, with both value and purpose.
Second, our importance to the Father is seen in His Son’s sacrifice on our behalf. Jesus shed His blood and paid for our transgressions so that we might be set free from sin.
Finally, God designed man to be in relationship with Him. Adam and Eve lived in the garden and had communion with their Creator. Abraham followed the Lord and was called God’s friend (James 2:23). Through faith in Jesus, we have become children of God and co-heirs with Christ (Romans 8:17). Our whole being—body, soul, and spirit—belongs to Him.
What do you value? Is there anything you need to let go of? Pursuing anything but Jesus won’t bring lasting satisfaction. True contentment is found when we remember how precious we are to God.
