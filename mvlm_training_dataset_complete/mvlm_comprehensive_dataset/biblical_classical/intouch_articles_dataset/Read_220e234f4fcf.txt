Trouble comes into every life, but God provides everything needed to survive and thrive.
We all will face trials. Realistically, you are either in a storm, just getting out of one, or about to enter one. That is the bad news. Here’s the good news: We serve a good God who provides beautifully—especially during the dark periods of life.
Today’s passage tells of a stormy night on the Sea of Galilee. Jesus provides for us today just as He did for His disciples then. Today, let’s look at some ways He does this.
First, the Father offers us His presence and the promise that He will never leave (Deuteronomy 31:8). We are able to live with a sense of comfort, courage, and confidence, no matter the circumstances.
Second, the Lord blesses His children with a pathway through trouble. He is in total control of our storm and will use the trial for His purpose. We may not understand, but we can trust His hand to guide us and accomplish good.
Third, the Father offers believers the potential to grow. Hardships are exercises in trust and times to learn more fully how great God’s power and love are.
No one enjoys hard times. But remember to express gratitude for God’s hand in your life and the way He will use the adversity. Even though trials are painful, they offer us the chance to trust our Creator and know Him better.
