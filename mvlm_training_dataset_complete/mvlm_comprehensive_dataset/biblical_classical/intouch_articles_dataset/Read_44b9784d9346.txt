The Shared Legacy of Believers
Choose to trust God in the face of difficulty, and He will give you the courage that’s needed to overcome.
We sometimes make the mistake of regarding the godly men and women of Scripture as being in a special category. We think and speak of them as if they were superheroes God raised up to do His work. But the truth is, they were people just like us.
These biblical saints experienced extreme difficulties and often endured loneliness in carrying out their calling. And yet they held tight to the promise that God would be with them (Deuteronomy 31:6; Deuteronomy 31:8). That’s why David could write, “Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for You are with me” (Ps. 23:4).
The Bible’s men and women of faith were convinced that they were doing God’s work. A person laboring under that belief possesses a zeal and a courage that all the forces of evil will never be able to destroy. We, likewise, are doing the Lord’s work in our world. We may not earn recognition, and we may face persecution. Whatever happens, we can be sure that God will be with us, enabling us to fulfill His purpose.
The legacy of the godly ones in Scripture is trust in the Lord and the courage to follow Him, even when obedience is inconvenient or difficult. Your legacy can be the same when you choose to obey the Lord.
