The Danger of Laziness
As Christ's ambassadors in a hurting world, we should represent Him by the way we live and interact with others.
2 Thessalonians 3:7-10
2 Thessalonians 3:7-10
The Lord has appointed believers to be His ambassadors to a lost and hurting world. As His followers, we are to represent Him in our character, conduct, and conversation whenever we interact with family, friends, neighbors, or coworkers.
God expects us to be diligent in our work and faithful to complete it (Colossians 3:23). However, it’s easy to get sidetracked into laziness. This sin is dangerous in a Christian’s life because of the potential harm that can result—it can hurt our witness for Christ, damage our relationships, and waste the time and gifts the Lord has given us.
Laziness frequently shows up as procrastination. Surely, if a believer is known as unreliable, it harms his or her testimony. We’re also a poor example if we attempt to carry out responsibilities but do so in a haphazard or incomplete way.
Irresponsible behavior doesn’t fit who we are in Christ. If you realize you’ve been careless in some area of your life, take heart:  Scripture promises that when we confess our wrongdoing, He is faithful to forgive us (1 John 1:9). Pray, “Lord, I have not lived as I should, and I ask You for Your forgiveness. I choose to turn away from my lazy and neglectful attitudes. Please help me to follow through and become someone who is industrious for You.”
