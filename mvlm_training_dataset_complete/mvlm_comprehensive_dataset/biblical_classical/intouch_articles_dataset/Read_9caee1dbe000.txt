Jesus, our example in all things, chose to serve others—even those He knew would desert Him.
When you hear the word success, what do you think of—wealth? power? How do you think God defines success? Micah 6:8 says this: “He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?”
And with Christ as our example, we should strive to be like Him. In today’s passage, we see how Jesus served. He performed the task of the lowliest servant when He took off His outer garment and washed the dirty feet of His followers—the very followers He knew would abandon Him. The next day, the Creator was crucified by people made in His image. In allowing this, He offered salvation to all—even those who nailed Him to a cross.
And Jesus asks that we follow His example of service. With the exception of Judas, His disciples obeyed. In fact, they all suffered because of their faith, many unto death.
Though we likely won’t endure what they did, ask the Lord how He is calling you to serve. In what ways do you spend your resources and time? And which topics dominate your thoughts and conversation? Service is a natural overflow of a relationship with Jesus. Ask Him to foster a servant’s attitude in your heart.
