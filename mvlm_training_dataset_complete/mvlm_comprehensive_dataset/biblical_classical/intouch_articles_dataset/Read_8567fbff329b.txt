Pass Down Your Principles
The best gifts are eternal, and they impact generations.
What do you want to leave your loved ones? Maybe it’s money or family heirlooms, like a favorite necklace or beloved photo. But if you’ve trusted Christ as Savior, you have something far more valuable. Material things can be spent or lost, but your faith—what you believe about Jesus Christ—is precious and eternal.
Choosing to follow Jesus is a personal decision, one you can’t make for anyone else. But through your words and actions, you can lovingly point others to the heavenly Father. Over the next few days, we’re going to look at three ways you can share your faith.
The first way is to share what you yourself have learned and practiced. For example, you can tell others that ...
God will give us direction. His Word is “a lamp to [our] feet and a light to [our] path” (Psalm 119:105).
God will provide for our needs, drawing from His unending riches (Philippians 4:19).
God will enable and strengthen us, whatever we go through. He’s a friend who sticks closer than a brother (Proverbs 18:24).
God owns everything, and we’re His trusted stewards.
What godly principles are you passing on to others? Is there anything you would add to the above list?
