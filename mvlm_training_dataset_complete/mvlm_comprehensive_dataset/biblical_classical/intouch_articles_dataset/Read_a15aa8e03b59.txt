Friendships That Last
For authentic connection, quality matters more than quantity.
Imagine a busy coffee shop. The aroma of freshly brewed beverages fills the air, and conversations echo off the walls. People come and go, exchanging pleasantries with each other, but not connecting on a deeper level. It’s a familiar scene in our fast-paced world, where many of our relationships remain shallow and transient. But God designed us for more.
Today’s scripture says, “A person of too many friends comes to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.” The verse reminds us that true joy is not about the quantity of friends—rather, it has to do with the quality of our relationships.
When we encounter someone who stands by us through thick and thin, who lends a listening ear without judgment, who offers support and encouragement, we glimpse the reflection of Christ’s love. Just as Jesus said, “Greater love has no one than this, that a person will lay down his life for his friends” (John 15:13). True friendship echoes this sacrificial love.
In a world that often seems too busy for genuine connections, let us cherish and cultivate the friendships that draw us closer to God’s heart. May we be the kind of friend who sticks closer than a brother, reflecting the love of our Savior in every word, action, and embrace we offer to others.
