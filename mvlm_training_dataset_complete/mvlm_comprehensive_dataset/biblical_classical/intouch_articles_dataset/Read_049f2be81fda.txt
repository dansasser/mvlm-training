Put God’s Priorities First
If we trust God and seek to honor Him in our decisions, we’ll have the chance to see Him work mightily.
Imagine if God showed up and said, “What do you want? Ask, and I’ll give it to you.” How would you answer? Most of us would ask for loved ones’ safety, enough money to meet our needs, or a long, healthy life. Solomon may have been tempted to name something similar—but he made a different request. What he wanted was an understanding heart so he could serve God’s people well.
Solomon’s life was full of personal needs and desires not so different from our own. But when given the opportunity to ask God for anything, he prioritized the Lord’s concerns. God was so pleased with the request that He gave Solomon not only wisdom but riches and honor as well (1 Kings 3:13)! This encounter foreshadows Jesus’ words in the Gospel of Matthew: “But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided to you” (Matthew 6:33).
God won’t necessarily give wealth, influence, or long life because we put His priorities first, but He will always be faithful to provide all we need according to His purposes. Solomon’s heart was set on seeking God’s kingdom and righteousness, and the Lord honored that in a multitude of ways—both tangible and intangible. When we make God’s priorities ours, we too will have the chance to see Him work mightily in our life.
