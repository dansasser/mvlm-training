You don't have to be afraid of anything—Almighty God is with You and promises to help.
Fear has been a part of our emotional makeup since the fall of man. When Adam and Eve rebelled against God, they hid themselves from Him and were afraid (Genesis 3:10). Things haven’t changed much. Anxiety often affects our thinking and controls our actions. It can keep us confined and unwilling to venture into unknown territory. Let truth help you defeat fear. Remember that God is …
• Almighty. Jesus set us free from slavery to sin; the Devil has lost control over our lives. What’s more, we no longer face eternal separation from God. Jesus’ physical death has become the gateway to heaven, where we can live with the Father forever.
• Always with us. In commissioning Joshua to lead the Israelites into the Promised Land, God promised to be with him (Joshua 1:5; Joshua 1:9). Jesus gives us similar reassurance (Matthew 28:20). Through the indwelling Holy Spirit, we as believers have God not only near us but also in us.
• Actively involved. God promises His help, and He always keeps His word (Numbers 23:19).
God Himself is the reason we should not be afraid. Grasp the truth of His power, presence, and involvement, and use them to disarm the landmine of fear.
