Do you feel stuck and unable to make good choices? Call on God for the power to overcome.
Freedom is a word that sounds wonderful, much like love or peace. But it isn’t easy to explain. We know we want freedom but may not be sure why—or what it could or should look like in everyday life.
While teaching on the Mount of Olives, Jesus told the crowd, “If you continue in My Word, then … you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free” (John 8:31-32). The people didn’t understand at first. They thought the Lord was talking about political freedom, but He was referring to a different type of liberation. Jesus wanted us to know that when we repent and put our trust in Him, God forgives us, freeing us from bondage to and punishment for sin.
In Romans 6:6-7, the apostle Paul continued the discussion with reassurance that sin loses its power over us when we surrender our life to the Lord. God offers victory over temptation and cleansing from the stain of sin (1 Corinthians 10:13; 1 John 1:9).
How have you experienced freedom from sin? Take a moment to express gratitude to the Lord for His unconditional love and forgiveness.
