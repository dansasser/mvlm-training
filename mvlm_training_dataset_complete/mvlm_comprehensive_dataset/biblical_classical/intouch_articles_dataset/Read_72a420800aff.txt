Love motivates us to move toward others—even when there are obstacles.
Jesus was the perfect model of servanthood. He “emptied Himself by taking the form of a bond-servant ... He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death” (Philippians 2:7-8). In other words, Jesus laid aside His divine nature to redeem us and save us from our sins.
In verse 5, Paul tells us that we, too, should have this attitude. But we aren’t called to sacrifice ourselves for mankind’s salvation, so is this same kind of humility even possible for us? Yes, by refusing to let our need for certainty and security keep us from approaching and, more importantly, loving and accepting those around us.
As Christians, we know that others have not yet embraced the reality and promise of the gospel. Ask yourself, How would Jesus approach them?  Today’s passage tells us: He was God, but He emptied Himself. He humbly reached out in love and humility to meet others exactly where they were.
Like Jesus, we can move toward others in love and mercy. It’s a self-sacrificial way of being. Though our obedience won’t lead to physical death, we must die to old ways of living so others can know Christ and experience the abundant life He offers.
