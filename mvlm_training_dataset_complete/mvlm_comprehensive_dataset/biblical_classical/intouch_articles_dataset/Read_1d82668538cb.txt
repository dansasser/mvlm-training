Learning to Pray the Bible Way
Jesus tells us to ask, seek, and knock when we pray.
Prayer has many benefits. For one thing, God delights in giving, so He wants His children to speak with Him regularly and ask for what’s on their heart. He also desires to fellowship with us, which happens when we spend time alone with Him. And, of course, communing with God is a way we discover wisdom for living and find “fullness of joy” in His presence (Psalm 16:11).
The privilege of prayer belongs to all who have a relationship with the Father through faith in His Son (John 1:12). God has also pledged to answer the sinner who asks for forgiveness and receives Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord (Romans 10:9).
In today’s passage, Jesus uses three verbs to describe prayer: ask, seek, and knock. Notice the progression in intensity from a request to a search and then to action. Prayer is more than giving God a list of wants. It involves seeking His will to guide our requests. It means “knocking on doors” by exploring different solutions and obtaining godly counsel. Jesus assured us that we will receive, we will find, and God will open the door.
Prayer is simple, yet at times we find it hard to practice. Ask the Lord to teach you more about what happens when you speak to Him. Put into practice what you learn and wait confidently for His answers!
