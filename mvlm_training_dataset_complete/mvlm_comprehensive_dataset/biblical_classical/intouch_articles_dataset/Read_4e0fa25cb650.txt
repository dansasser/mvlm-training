Developing Convictions
Consistently spending time in God's Word transforms our thinking and strengthens our beliefs.
An acorn needs nutrients and time to grow into a tall, sturdy oak tree. Likewise, believers of conviction develop through committed study and prayer. Here are questions to get you started:
Do you consider the Bible true and trustworthy?
Is believing in Jesus as Lord the only way to be saved?
Are we to forgive others in every situation?
What’s your purpose in life?
What is your role in the church and at work?
How should you think and act regarding social issues?
What role does the Holy Spirit play—in both the lives of believers and unbelievers?
A concordance will point you to scriptures that relate to these topics and others. Evaluate what the Bible says instead of looking at an issue only through the lens of personal preference. Ask, What does God say? instead of simply, What does this mean to me?
Make Scripture the cornerstone of your thinking. Once you know what the Lord says, you have a choice: Believe Him and commit to living according to your convictions, or continue being tossed by waves of doubt (James 1:6). By rooting yourself in God’s Word, you can be called one of His oaks of righteousness (Isaiah 61:3).
