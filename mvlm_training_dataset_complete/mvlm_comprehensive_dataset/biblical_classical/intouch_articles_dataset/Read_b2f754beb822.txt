Jesus sees our deepest desires and understands our true needs—even when we don't.
We’ve all wondered what heaven is really like. If you had the ability to create such a place, what would you want to see there?
At first the answer seems easy, but after some thought, it becomes apparent we could never clearly identify things that would give eternal satisfaction—everything falls far short. The sad truth is, there are people who spend a great deal of time pursuing something (or someone), only to come to the conclusion that it wasn’t what they really wanted. The problem is this: Left to ourselves, we may not know who or what it is we really want.
That’s one reason we have a great High Priest presiding over the throne of grace. Hebrews 4:13 says, “There is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.” In other words, Jesus Christ sees what it is we really want and need, even when we ourselves do not recognize what that might be.
Better still, He is lovingly encouraging us to “draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need” (Heb. 4:16). Be assured that Jesus, your great High Priest, knows the true desires of your heart, and He is fitting you for heaven, a place perfectly prepared for you.
