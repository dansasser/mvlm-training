When Loneliness Overwhelms
What should you do when you feel alone?
Solitude can be nice—relaxing, even—especially after a busy day or a long shift at work. Spending time alone can leave you feeling recharged and rested. But loneliness is different.
So, what should you do if you feel lonely? First, ask yourself if you’ve accepted Jesus’ invitation to have a personal relationship with Him. He is the nearest, dearest friend you can ever have. Second, remember that God repeatedly promises that He will never leave or abandon you. (See Deuteronomy 31:6; Joshua 1:5; Joshua 1:9; Psalm 27:10; John 14:18.) You can also ...
Pray. Ask the Lord to help you have a right understanding of who you are as His child. Scripture tells us that God loves us with an everlasting love (Jeremiah 31:3) and that He is a friend who sticks closer than a brother (Proverbs 18:24). Ask Him to help you to feel His love and friendship.
Memorize the Lord’s promises. We mentioned a few up above, but are there any you want to add?
Prayerfully examine Scripture to find a few that encourage you.
Pray about godly friendships. Ask God to bring the right people into your life—particularly those with whom you can laugh and pray. Friendship is an extension of the Lord’s love and goodness in your life.
