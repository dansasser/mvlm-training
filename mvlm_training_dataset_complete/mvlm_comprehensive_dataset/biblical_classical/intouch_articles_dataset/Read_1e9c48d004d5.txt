The call of God is a wonderful opportunity to see Him work powerfully through you.
God has issued some dramatic calls to service. Moses heard His voice from a burning bush (Exodus 3:1-22), whereas Isaiah saw a vision of heaven’s throne room (Isaiah 6:1-13). However, a spectacle is the exception rather than the rule. For many who go to the mission field, God’s call is a persistent tug on the heart. It is a whisper in their spirit, asking, “How can they hear about him unless someone tells them?” (Rom. 10:14 NLT).
People can try to ignore the feeling, block the ever-present call with activity, or quiet it by giving money. Some say no outright. But the call persists; God’s will is set and His plan is steadfast. Jonah’s life serves as an example of how we may try to run but cannot escape His call to serve (Jonah 1:1; Jonah 3:1).
The road of obedience will certainly be marked with challenges. But thankfully, the rewards of serving are greater than any hardship, and the Lord promises never to leave or forsake us. Remember that Jesus promised Peter a hundred-fold return on his investment in the kingdom (Mark 10:28-30).
Carrying the gospel is a great opportunity to serve God. What better way to thank Him for saving us than to share that experience with others. If the Lord is calling you, say yes and see what amazing, life-changing work He will do through you.
