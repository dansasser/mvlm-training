Sunday Check-in With Dr. Stanley: Finding a Local Church
Have you discovered a congregation to call home?
In some cities, there’s a church building on nearly every corner, but congregations can vary widely. Some focus mainly on outreach; others, on education. How can you know if a church is right for you?
When considering a fellowship, believers should be humble and curious. Take time to quietly observe services and relationships. Then ask yourself whether the church teaches these four truths:
1. Our Savior was both fully human and fully God.
2. After His crucifixion and burial, Jesus was resurrected.
3. Salvation comes only through faith in Jesus.
4. The Bible is divine revelation given to us so that we can have a personal relationship with God.
A church’s primary focus should be on redemption, which can be summed up this way: Because God the Father loves us, He redeemed us through His Son, saving all who believe (John 3:16).
Our beliefs influence how we view God, others, and ourselves, so it’s important to choose a congregation wisely. Ultimately, the church your neighbor attends might not be right for you—and that’s okay. What’s important is to join the body of Christ and learn the truth about the God who loves you.
