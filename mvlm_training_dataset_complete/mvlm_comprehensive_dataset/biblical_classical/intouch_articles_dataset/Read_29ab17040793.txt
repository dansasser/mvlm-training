Victory Over Unforgiveness
When you are hurt, trust God with your pain, and ask for His help to overcome any wrong attitudes that linger.
After teaching His followers to pray, Jesus gave a warning about allowing unforgiveness to reside in the heart. He said that those who refuse to forgive others won’t be forgiven by the Father. Be careful not to misunderstand Jesus’ meaning here. We don’t lose our salvation when we refuse to pardon others. Rather, we break fellowship with God because an unrepentant attitude interferes with regular confession and turning away from sin.
Forgiveness is an act of the will more than an act of the heart. We don’t often feel like showing mercy to someone who’s wronged us—but that’s exactly what we’re called to do (Matthew 5:38-40). A resentful spirit grows into a terrible burden. The Lord knows that forgiveness is best, even when it is difficult. Claim the divine mercy He offers, and ask Him to enable you to lay aside anger and resentment. As part of the decision to move forward in grace, make a habit of praying for those who hurt you. And if God so leads, seek their forgiveness for your wrong attitude or actions.
A bitter spirit doesn’t fit who we are in Christ. That’s why Scripture emphasizes the need to forgive. Choose to be liberated from your burden—Jesus promised to make us free when we choose to believe and obey Him (John 8:31-32).
