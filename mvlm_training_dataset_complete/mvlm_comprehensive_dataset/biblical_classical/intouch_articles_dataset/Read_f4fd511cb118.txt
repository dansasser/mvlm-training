Every life is precious in God’s sight—and should be in our sight as well.
“What do you think?” Jesus asks His disciples in Matthew 18. “If any man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains, and go and search for the one that is lost?” (v. 12).
Well, what do we think? If we had a hundred sheep and one of them wandered away, I’m not sure any of us would leave the rest to go searching. It’s likely that the single missing animal would feel like a reasonable loss—a small impact on the bottom line, something already factored into the budget.
But in this passage, Jesus makes it clear just how precious “these littles ones” are to Him. He is driving home a point about the person who seems worthless—the one we tend to overlook or don’t care much about: That’s the one God is looking out for.
In other words, God’s spreadsheet doesn’t look like ours. In His budget, there are no calculations for loss with regard to His “little ones.” No one is considered collateral damage. That’s good news, because the One who watches over lost lambs and tiny sparrows is watching out for us as well. But these are also challenging words, for God asks us to live with compassion, too. Thankfully, His grace is sufficient to equip us for this good work.
