Our best life is found when we trust God completely and live surrendered to His will.
God created us with a longing to know that we matter. He also designed us to find the fulfillment of that desire through His Son.
Dependence on God is central to an abundant life. Trusting Him with all our heart means giving Him control over everything—our family, finances, emotions, and thoughts. Today’s passage emphasizes how essential trust is to a fruitful life: It cautions against being wise in our own eyes and warns not to lean on our own understanding (vv. 5, 7). When faced with decisions, it’s tempting to choose the answer we think is right. But we can’t know all the facts or predict with certainty how others will respond. The Lord, however, does know. He reads our heart and perceives every thought (1 Chronicles 28:9). No aspect of our situation escapes His notice (Psalm 11:4), and He cares about everyone. That’s why He alone is certain which decision will be best.
The abundant life also involves acknowledging God in all we do. Speaking about Him is just part of what it means to give Him recognition. As His children, we’re to have a marked resemblance to our heavenly Father—in thoughts, attitudes, and actions.
Life becomes fruitful as we surrender ourselves to God and carry out His will. When His Spirit lives through us (Galatians 2:20), our life will be characterized by significance and satisfaction.
