Growing ever closer to God should be our first priority, for that is the path to life's greatest blessings.
Pursuing God through His Son Jesus is to be our highest aim. To seek Him, what actions can we take?
First, we need to study the Bible. A structured, ongoing examination of God’s Word causes our faith to grow and provides what we need for life and godliness (2 Peter 1:3). Next, we must maintain an active prayer life. This means regularly conversing—both speaking and listening—with God. Third, we are to prayerfully contemplate what we read in Scripture. Through the guidance of the Holy Spirit, we will gain understanding of Scripture’s application to life. This process helps us absorb divine truths and live by them.
As we learn biblical principles, we become truly wise in a way that glorifies God. Then it becomes easier to identify where He’s at work and to evaluate our circumstances in light of His character and plan. And as we listen to God, we will grow, develop a willingness to act, and strengthen our determination not to be distracted.
God promises to reward our seeking. Sometimes we will be blessed with greater understanding; at other times, with inexplicable joy. Best of all, whenever we seek Him, we will find Him (Jeremiah 29:13). There is joy in both the pursuit and the discovery.
