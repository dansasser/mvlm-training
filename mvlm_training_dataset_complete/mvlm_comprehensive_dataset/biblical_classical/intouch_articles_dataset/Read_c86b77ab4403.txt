Our Quiet Communication
Do your actions and attitudes match your spoken words?
2 Thessalonians 3:7-9
The Lord calls us to share His truth with others, but sometimes our actions and attitudes can contradict the words that are coming out of our mouth.
Every day, most of us communicate something to someone. We send messages by what we say and by what we don’t say, by what we do and by what we don’t do. For example, if parents decide to stop tithing their income, they are sending a message to their children. Without ever saying anything, they are teaching their kids that Mom and Dad don’t believe God is faithful to provide. What our conduct conveys—especially to children—speaks much louder than the words we use.
The apostle Paul understood that powerful lessons are taught by our actions. For this reason, he made sure he modeled the right behavior and values for his spiritual children to observe and emulate (2 Thessalonians 3:7-9).
It is not an issue of whether or not we will communicate a message. Rather, the issue is, What kind of message are you already communicating? Search yourself for any disparity between what you say and what you do, and choose to share a complete, unified message of hope with the world.
