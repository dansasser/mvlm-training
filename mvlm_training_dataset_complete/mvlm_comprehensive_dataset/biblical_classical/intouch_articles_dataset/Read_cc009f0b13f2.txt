The Lord's unchanging goodness provides the stability and confidence we need for all seasons of life.
One of the earliest truths a child learns in Sunday school is that God is good. The simplicity of these three words masks the depth of such a remarkable attribute of the Lord. He is perfect and holy, which means that He alone is the standard of all righteousness. And since the expression of the Father’s goodness is revealed in His actions, all that He does is good and right. After all, He cannot violate His own nature.
God does not change (Malachi 3:6). His character, not our behavior, determines how He deals with us. As a loving heavenly Father, He responds to disobedience with discipline (Hebrews 12:6), which is designed to restore our broken relationship.
The Lord’s goodness is expressed in a multitude of ways. He is our Creator. Our every breath is given to us by God. As our loving Shepherd, He watches over and provides for us. But the greatest expression of His goodness is the cross, where He lovingly bore our sin so we could have a relationship with Him.
Believing in God’s goodness is essential for our faith. This truth fills us with joy in happy times and grounds us with confidence during hard seasons. When we don’t understand what the Lord is doing, we can trust His heart and know that He is good.
