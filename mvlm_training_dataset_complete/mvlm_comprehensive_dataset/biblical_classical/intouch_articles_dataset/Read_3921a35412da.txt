Trouble may come, but God provides eternal safety for His children.
In Psalm 121, David describes the safety that he found in the Lord. Over the next two days, we’ll look closely at several verses to better understand the security we also enjoy.
“I will lift up my eyes to the mountains; from where shall my help come? My help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth” (vv. 1-2). When this was written, robbers dwelled in the mountains, waiting for travelers to become their unsuspecting victims. David’s work as a shepherd took him into dangerous areas, where not only thieves but also wild animals posed a threat. Our lives can be like mountainous territory. Thankfully, the Lord is our helper; He is the only one able to completely protect us.
“He will not allow your foot to slip” (v. 3). God has provided everything we need in order to avoid sin. The Holy Spirit directs and empowers us; the Word lights our path so we don’t fall. He upholds us, enabling us to walk in His way.
These opening verses of the psalm focus on the Lord’s ability to protect us in treacherous times. Whether trouble originates with others, external circumstances, or our own sin, we can find ourselves in danger and afraid. Thankfully, we have a loving God who leads us to safety.
