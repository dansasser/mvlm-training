Letting go of what is known can be difficult, but where God leads, blessing follows.
Today’s passage describes what happened when Peter reported back to Jerusalem about his visit with Cornelius (Acts 10:1-48). Some Jewish believers didn’t like what they heard and “took issue with him” (11:2). So Peter explained to the fledgling Christian community what God had expressed to him through a vision.
We can learn something important from the people’s response to Peter’s story. His experience required them to reevaluate their assumptions about God’s work in the world. Thankfully, instead of stubbornly sticking to their wrong beliefs about salvation, they listened and “quieted down.” Then they concluded, “Well then, God has also granted to the Gentiles the repentance that leads to life” (v. 18).
Sometimes what God is doing presses against things we hold dear. In those moments, we have a choice. We can reject the present for the past, which some Jews did—they refused to let go of the old way, even though the gospel pointed to something new. A second option is to ignore the past and press ahead as we like.
Life in the kingdom, however, offers a third way: Receive God’s Word, reflect quietly, and respond in grace. Peter’s audience did just that—making that new world their home instead of clinging to what had come before.
