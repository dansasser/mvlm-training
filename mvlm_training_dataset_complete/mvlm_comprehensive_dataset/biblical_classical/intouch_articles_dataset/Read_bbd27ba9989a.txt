Peace Beyond Comprehension
When feeling anxious, share your concerns with God to receive His peace in your mind and heart.
As mentioned on this month’s Getting Started page, the apostle Paul wrote his epistle to the Philippians from a prison cell. Though his situation was dire, true inner tranquility was available. Paul knew that giving his concerns over to God would result in the peace “which surpasses all comprehension” (v. 7).
From a human perspective, having a quiet spirit in a storm of trouble doesn’t make any sense. We’re “supposed” to become anxious—it’s only natural. But our God is supernatural, and He is living inside us in the form of the Holy Spirit, so we can remain peaceful.
No matter what trying circumstances may challenge our faith, peace grounded in Jesus Christ cannot be broken. With the Father’s omnipotent hand protecting and providing for us, what reason do we have to be afraid or fretful? We must keep our eyes and our faith focused upon the Lord. As Isaiah writes, “The steadfast of mind You will keep in perfect peace, because he trusts in You” (Isaiah 26:3).
We live in a world of conflict and often find ourselves suffering heartache. It’s easy to become fixated on a situation and how it has disrupted our life. But peace comes from choosing to trust that God will bring about a resolution in His time and in His way.
