Why We Need Spiritual Discernment
When faced with a decision that seems to have several good answers, rely on the Holy Spirit for guidance.
Things aren’t always what they seem. That’s the mantra of many mystery books and TV shows, but it’s also a wise attitude for life. Many people make decisions based on feelings or judge situations by what appears to be ideal. Thankfully, God has given every believer a spirit of discernment to help us determine what’s best.
Think about how many decisions we must make on a daily basis—choices about family, finances, work. In a perfect world, each decision would have a correct and incorrect choice. In reality, however, what seems right isn’t always best. Some things that are neither wrong nor sinful may still be outside God’s will for us.
Scripture doesn’t contain specific directives about every possible life scenario. Instead, it’s filled with principles laid down by direct teaching or, at times, through stories. As we grow in spiritual maturity, biblical principles coupled with guidance from the Holy Spirit help us make godly judgments. (See 2 Peter 1:3.)
The question isn’t whether a certain choice looks good or feels right, but whether it’s God’s will for that point in our life. A spirit of discernment is essential for living in His will. Many choices that feel appropriate are actually contrary to what the Lord desires. That is why we must evaluate situations from a biblical perspective and ask the Spirit to guide us.
