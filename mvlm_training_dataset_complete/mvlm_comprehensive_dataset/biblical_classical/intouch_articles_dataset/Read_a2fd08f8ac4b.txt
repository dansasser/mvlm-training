Jesus came to provide a way for us to have a relationship with our heavenly Father.
The Christmas rush is here. There are plans to make, gifts to buy, and parties to attend. These activities can leave us exhausted—instead of experiencing peace and joy, we may feel overwhelmed because there’s too much to do. What’s more, this time of year can bring sad memories and loneliness. And maybe unrealistic expectations or conflicts with loved ones leave us discouraged.
How can Jesus be our Prince of Peace when we feel everything but peace? To understand why the Lord was given this title, we must first understand what it means. Jesus did not come to do away with all conflicts—not yet, anyway. One day He will return to earth and rule as King in an environment of external harmony. But He said that in this present life, we’d have trouble (John 16:33).
When Christ came to earth, His goal was to bring us peace by reconciling us to the Father. His death on the cross paid our sin debt in full, and our relationship with God is restored. Now Jesus offers us divine peace—an inner serenity that fills our heart and mind no matter what is going on in our circumstances.
Is your life characterized by a quiet assurance that guards your thinking and emotions all day long? Try setting aside time each day to fix your eyes upon Jesus. Then let Him heal your heart and calm your spirit.
