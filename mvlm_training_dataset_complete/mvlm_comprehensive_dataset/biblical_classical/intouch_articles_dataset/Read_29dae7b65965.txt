A Life That God Rewards
Are you honoring God with the gifts He has entrusted to you?
Today’s passage shows us one of the greatest rewards we could possibly receive: hearing the Lord say, “Well done, good and faithful servant” (vv. 21-23 NIV). Just imagine being acknowledged in that way!
It’s important to examine yourself to determine if you’re living a life that God will praise. Consider these areas:
Your mind: When you wake up, is your mind bent toward the Lord or toward all you must do over the next few hours?
Your desires: Do you want to listen to God, walk in His ways, and let Him accomplish His will for your life?
Your deeds: Is obeying God your top priority? He desires for you to be a faithful steward. (See 1 John 2:5-6.)
Your pureheartedness: Do you tolerate sin in your life? A godly person readily confesses wrongdoing before the Lord.
Your time: Are you spending your time on worthless things or investing it in the kingdom of God?
The Lord is calling each of us to be a faithful steward of everything He’s given us. Every day counts because our rewards for this life will be eternal. How foolish to live for the world when we could live for Christ and hear Him say, “Well done!”
