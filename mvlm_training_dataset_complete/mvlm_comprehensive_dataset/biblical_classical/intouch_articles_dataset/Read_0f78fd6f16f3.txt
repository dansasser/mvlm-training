Today Is the Day of Salvation
Have you made the decision to trust Jesus as your Savior?
We all will spend eternity somewhere.  The destination is determined by whether we accept or reject Jesus’ offer of forgiveness. But eternity seems distant, so some people feel that they can delay this decision. They assume, I’ll just wait until I’m closer to death. Then I’ll ask Jesus to save me.
The problems with this reasoning are obvious. First of all, there’s no guarantee you’ll have any warning before death. Second, by spending a lifetime rejecting Christ’s offer, you run the risk of developing a hardened heart. Hebrews 3:13 says, “Encourage one another … so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.” Saying no to God frequently throughout your life may result in being unable to say yes when death comes knocking at the door. We must be careful not to abuse the grace of God. All people who are not protected by salvation in Jesus Christ will face the reality of judgment. (See Hebrews 10:26-27.)
By putting off a decision for Christ, you not only lose the immediate blessings of a deeply personal relationship with God now; you also risk future separation from Him for all eternity. Don’t wait! Come to Christ today: Acknowledge your sin, ask His forgiveness, and trust Him as your Savior.
