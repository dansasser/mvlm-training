Weathering the Storms of Life
What are you doing to remember God's past faithfulness?
The disciples experienced many “mountaintop moments” in their time with Jesus: The synagogue ruler’s daughter was brought back to life; two men had their sight restored; the mute were enabled to speak; and a demon-possessed man was set free. But as we saw yesterday, a storm arose on the sea, and when the disciples saw Jesus walking on the water, fear invaded their hearts (Matthew 14:24-26).
In times of adversity, we sometimes forget our knowledge of God, too. We might fail to recall past answers to prayer, guidance provided by the Holy Spirit, and lessons learned in prior crises.
Reading Scripture is a key to remembering biblical truths. Another important resource is a journal that lists ways the Father has previously worked in your life. It serves as a map to trace where you have been and how He has helped you along the way. While your current trial may be a new one, you can look back to see the Lord’s unchangeable nature over the years.
As Christians, we have an enemy who wants our focus diverted from the Lord Jesus. Let’s spend time in the Word and record what the Lord has done in our life. Doing so will help us remember how Jesus has provided for us personally and protected us with His divine power.
