The Foundation of Unwavering Faith
Jesus is our anchor for all the storms of life—and He always will be.
In our ever-changing world, friendships drift, families move, and technology advances. If we seek security in people, position, or possessions, we’re going to be disappointed. Yet we all need somewhere to turn during the storms of life. The one true anchor for our soul is Jesus, who never changes. To find comfort in Him, we must learn who He is and how He works. Today we will explore a few details about His life and character.
John 1:1 reveals that Jesus was Deity from the beginning. Fully God and fully man, He was born of a virgin, lived 33 years on earth, was crucified despite His innocence, and rose after three days. He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life—the Christ, the Son of the living God (John 14:6; Matthew 16:16). Our Lord fulfilled innumerable Old Testament prophecies, such as Isaiah 53. Like us, Jesus has feelings—He wept for hurting people and felt angry when people misused the temple. Most importantly, His resurrection defeated death, and He still lives today.
The merciful, loving, compassionate, and holy Jesus we know from Scripture is the same Messiah we can cling to today. Difficult circumstances are inevitable. Prepare yourself for them by learning who Jesus is—He’s the only true Shelter and Rock that will not change. What a wonderful Savior!
