God’s Goal in Communicating
Those who are willing to hear, apply, and share God's truth benefit from it.
When the Lord has something important to say to us, we can trust that it is for our benefit and invariably speaks directly to our needs (Isaiah 48:17). So we must be clear in asking, What is God’s primary purpose in speaking to me? What does He want me to do as a result of what He’s said? We’ll learn God speaks so that ...
We are able to comprehend the truth. That is, He wants us to fully understand His message and absorb it into our heart and mind.
We may be aligned with the truth. Just knowing biblical principles is not enough; we must apply them to our circumstances and live out the life of faith.
We can then communicate the truth. Hearing scriptural principles and applying them to our situation is just the beginning. Our Father wants us to share that life-changing knowledge with others.
How can you better understand biblical truth? How can you more effectively apply God’s principles and share them with others? The Lord is always ready and able to help you discover the answers to these questions. Open yourself to His message today, and then submit to whatever the Holy Spirit tells you.
