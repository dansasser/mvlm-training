Sanctification: God’s Grand Plan
The moment we trust Jesus as Savior, we are adopted into God's family and set apart with a sacred purpose.
The heavenly Father has a plan for the life of every person, and it can be summed up with the word sanctification.
In its verb form—sanctify—the term means “to make holy” or “to separate.” So when something is sanctified, it is separated from its former existence and dedicated for sacred purposes. The Old Testament mentions a number of things that the Lord sanctified: He made the seventh day holy, set aside the Levite tribe as priests, and even consecrated places like the Holy of Holies inside the tabernacle (Genesis 2:3; Numbers 3:1-51; Exodus 40:9-11).
Our Father sanctifies people today as well. Before a person trusts in Christ, he or she is spiritually dead (Ephesians 2:1-3). But the moment the choice is made to place faith in Jesus, sins are wiped away and the individual is adopted into God’s family—set apart as a child of God with a sacred purpose. This means believers aren’t here to chase after personal gain but are to serve the Lord and bring Him glory.
As members of God’s family who are called upon to reflect Him to the world, believers are referred to as “saints.” We’re given this title—which shares its root with sanctification—not because we have attained sinless perfection but because we live a life consistent with the One we represent.
