Christmas: A Time for Giving
On this final day before Christmas, ask God to help you see who needs the gifts you can give.
During the Christmas season, generosity is often evident. We see that in the Christmas story, too—everyone had something to give:
When Mary submitted to God’s plan, she gave her body to be the first home of the Savior (Luke 1:30-38). In doing so, she risked her good reputation to fulfill the Lord’s calling for her life.
Joseph offered his love and protection to Mary and the child (Matthew 1:18-25).
An angel gave an announcement of the Messiah’s birth to the shepherds.
A heavenly host of angels offered praise and glory to God.
Shepherds shared the first testimony about Jesus.
The wise men gave Him gifts worthy of royalty (Matthew 2:1-11).
At first glance, these gifts may seem to pertain only to the first Christmas, but they each have application for us today. Believers are called to give of themselves to the Lord and to one another in similar ways.
Look at this list again. What gifts could you give to Christ today? Maybe you need to submit to His will in a difficult area or endure misunderstanding in order to obey Him. And how about gifts to those around you? Who needs your protection, love, time, or perhaps the good news of salvation in Christ?
