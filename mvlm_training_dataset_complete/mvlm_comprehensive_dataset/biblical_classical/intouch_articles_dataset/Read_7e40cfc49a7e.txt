The Blessings of Loyalty
A decision to serve and love often comes with sacrifice, but it is always rewarded by God.
Ruth’s remarkable loyalty is what earned her a place in both the Bible and the lineage of Jesus (Matthew 1:1-5). Ruth is an example of faithfulness—she willingly adjusted her own life to meet the needs of her mother-in-law Naomi.
With no family left to care for her and no neighbors who shared her faith in God, Naomi found herself in a foreign land, far from the comfort of a familiar community. During that dark time, Ruth—her son’s widow—sacrificed everything to stay by Naomi’s side. The younger woman even chose to move to a foreign country and to worship Naomi’s God.
Ruth was undoubtedly aware of the risks involved in casting her lot with another woman in a male-dominated society, but she did so without hesitation. And her commitment did not end when they arrived in Israel. It was Ruth who kept the two women fed. And it was Ruth, under Naomi’s tutelage, who made an alliance with Boaz that secured their future.
Ruth sacrificed mightily for her mother-in-law, and as a result, God blessed her greatly. He loved her and gave her a husband, a home, and a child. Moreover, Ruth is counted among the ancestors of the Messiah, Jesus Christ. What an awesome testimony of the blessings bestowed on a loyal heart.
