When you confidently pursue God’s call, He will overcome every obstacle and empower you to succeed.
When you encounter opportunities to serve the Lord, how do you respond? God wants us to be servants willing to seek His specific plan for our life and to do whatever He calls us to do. He uniquely gifts His followers to serve according to His will. But if we’ve already decided what we can’t, won’t, or are ill-equipped to do, then we’re acting by our own will. We don’t want to miss the blessings that come with trusting God.
You may serve the Lord as a godly parent, as an employee who shares the gospel with coworkers, or as a friend who listens to people who are hurting. There is no restriction on what God can do with a willing heart. The strength of His Spirit overcomes human limitations. Don’t have enough courage? God can fix that. Don’t have the right skills? God can fix that too.
Laying down our excuses is the wisest thing we can do to serve the Lord. Trust that He will empower you to accomplish whatever He calls you to do—and will see to it that you are properly equipped and trained (2 Timothy 3:16-17; Hebrews 13:20-21). All He asks of you is that you say yes.
