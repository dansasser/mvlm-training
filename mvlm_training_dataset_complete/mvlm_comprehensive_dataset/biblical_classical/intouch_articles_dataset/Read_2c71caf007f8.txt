Growing to Hear Him Better
When you approach God, remember that He receives you with love, compassion, and tenderness.
Have you ever noticed that the more time you spend with someone, the better you understand where that person is coming from? Our relationship with Jesus is similar. When we have a close connection with Him, we’re not praying to some cold and distant deity “out there somewhere.” Instead, we are speaking with a God who loves us, sustains us, and molds us into His own image. That changes how we approach Him, doesn’t it?
In today’s passage, Peter, James, and John witnessed Jesus’ transfiguration and were terrified. Though the sight must have been shocking, it’s as if the three men momentarily forgot that they served a loving and forgiving king. While it’s important to revere and respect the Lord, we should not be frightened of Him. After all, it’s His love and grace that makes Him a Savior worth following.
Coming to the three disciples, who’d fallen to the ground, Jesus “touched them and said, ‘Get up, and do not be afraid’” (v. 7). That’s the kind of compassionate, personal God we serve, and we should keep that picture in mind when we spend time with Him.
If you’re struggling to connect with God, remember that He loves you, forgives you, and rejoices in your prayers.
