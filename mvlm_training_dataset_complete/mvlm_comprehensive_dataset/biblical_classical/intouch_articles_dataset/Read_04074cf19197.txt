The Greater Purpose of Blessings
God blesses His children by giving them opportunities to help others know Him.
It is God’s nature to bless. However, His purpose for doing so is greater than we may realize. It’s never the Lord’s intention for His blessings to end with us. Rather, He wants them to flow to others.
As we see in today’s psalm, the Lord blesses us so that His salvation, His ways, and His justice may be known by every nation and people group around the globe (vv. 3-4, 7). He’s always acting with this larger picture in mind.
This should fill us with an awesome—yet humbling—sense of significance. Every believer has a part in helping others know and understand God. Each blessing that benefits us personally is also intended to help further His plans for the kingdom. On the other hand, we sometimes may not receive things we want because they don’t contribute to God’s higher purpose. But if we fit our requests into the Lord’s greater plans, we position ourselves to be used mightily by Him.
When the Lord blesses you, He’s not only doing something for you; He’s also doing something in and through you to affect the lives of others. Don’t let the pleasures and comforts of His blessings make you lose sight of their intended purpose. As we enter into this new year, ask God how you can use His kindnesses to point people to Him.
