God patiently guides drifting believers back into His will.
In a studio, the potter has complete power over the clay. The same is true of God: As our Creator, He can do with us whatever He chooses. That might sound scary, but remember that God’s sovereignty cannot be separated from His other attributes.
While the Lord is sovereign, He is also loving, gracious, and thorough—and that influences how He shapes us. Just as a potter works the clay with patience, God forms our Christlike character slowly—one experience at a time. He knows that spiritual maturity can’t be rushed.
And just as clay can slip from the middle of the wheel, we too might find ourselves off-center from time to time—whether due to an old wound, a new hardship, a recurring habit, or something else. However, we don’t have to worry. In His grace, God always maneuvers the drifting believer back into position and begins remolding. He never discards His vessels but patiently works to mold them.
Our Father is a personal Potter. His creations reflect Him, and His Spirit is poured into each believing vessel so He can be an intimate part of our life. The result is a work of true beauty—a saint dearly loved by the Lord.
