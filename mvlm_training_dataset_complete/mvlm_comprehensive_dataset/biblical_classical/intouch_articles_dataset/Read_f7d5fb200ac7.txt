Our Inseparable Relationship
God will never stop loving you—no matter what.
God is love. His nature requires that He love His creation unconditionally. This means that no matter what we do, He will not stop caring about us. After reading that sentence, many people are going to think of reasons why they are an exception. So let’s be clear: God has deep love for each and every one of us, and the only thing preventing us from experiencing it is our response.
Romans 8:31 tells us God is on the side of the believer. In order for us to be purified and enter into a relationship with Him, He gave up His Son to death. Jesus’ sacrifice itself is proof of God’s love, but there are many additional expressions of His care for us. The Lord has a purpose and plan for every one of His children. Through His sovereign control, He works every situation—good and bad—to our benefit (Romans 8:28). He is a loving Father who not only is interested in what happens to us but also is actively involved in our daily life.
Some people read and intellectually believe every word of the Bible but still feel unloved because they judge themselves unworthy. Their doubt acts like a dam. The barrier will hold as long as the person believes God’s love must be deserved or earned. But thankfully, our Father is patient and freely gives His love to us as we work to understand the truth.
