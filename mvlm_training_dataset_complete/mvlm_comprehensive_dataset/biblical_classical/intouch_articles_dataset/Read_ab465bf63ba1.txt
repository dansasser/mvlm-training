We are wise if we take the time to pray and consider the consequences.
Yesterday we read about Esau forfeiting his future for present gratification. If we’re not careful, we might do the same thing. Even the unremarkable choices we make each day are able to impact our life. Let’s look at three attitudes that can lead to sacrificing what is worthwhile for something that isn’t:
1. Allowing appetites to rule us. We all have need of things like food, companionship, and sleep. While our desires for them are natural and God-given, they can become the driving force in our life if we aren’t careful.
2. Being blind to what’s truly valuable. The Lord’s priorities are contrary to what the world considers important. Unless we guard our heart (Proverbs 4:23), we can easily be lured by pursuits with no lasting worth.
3. Failing to Consider Consequences. Eve didn’t contemplate what might happen if she ate the forbidden fruit; she focused on the short-term benefit (Genesis 3:1-19). Nor did Samson think about repercussions from interactions with Delilah (Judges 16:16-23). How easy it is to make a rash decision because the immediate return seems good. The Lord wants us to pause and pray about the possible outcomes of our actions.
What decisions are you facing? Prayerfully consider what is driving you, and before making choices, think about potential effects of your actions.
