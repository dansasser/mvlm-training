If a relationship with God is our priority, we can rest, knowing He will direct our path.
Scripture tells us that Enoch’s walk with the Father was so close that “God took him” (Gen. 5:24). This implies Enoch didn’t die but was taken directly into the Lord’s presence. It pleases God when His children seek to follow Him with this same closeness. Consider these aspects of a vibrant walk with the Lord:
Reconciliation. This term essentially means “God moving toward us.” We can be joyful because the responsibility is all His. Through the cross of Christ, God has already made His move in our direction. 2 Corinthians 5:18 says, “Now all these things are from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation.”
Trusting God. We must have faith that, through Jesus, God provides all we need in order to walk intimately with Him.
Agreement. To appreciate the closeness God longs to have with us, we must agree with what Scripture teaches about His Son, His Word, the church, and sin.
Fellowship. Just as human relationships fall apart without regular interaction, our intimacy with God weakens when we don’t spend time with Him.
The walk of faith is a beautiful journey. When we seek the Lord above all else, He’ll direct our path (Proverbs 3:5-6).
