Jesus Is Interruptible
Choose to see interruptions as opportunities to love like Jesus.
In our passage today, the Lord was on His way somewhere but stopped to heal a blind man. He could easily have passed by—Jesus was a busy man, after all. But He allowed Himself to be interrupted, and one person’s life was forever changed.
“I am the Light of the world,” Jesus said before applying mud to the man’s sightless eyes (v. 5). The thought of putting mud in a blind man’s eyes to clear his vision might seem strange to us today. However, Jewish onlookers may have recognized this as a medical practice of the day. It’s even possible they interpreted it as a new act of creation, since mud could have reminded them of God forming Adam from the dust of the earth. If such scriptural imagery was, in fact, Jesus’ intention, it would convey that He truly was the Word who was with God in the beginning—one with God Himself.
Whatever the reason for this unusual-sounding treatment, we know that dirt and saliva became holy instruments in Jesus’ healing hands. So let’s consider what God might be doing in our midst and pray for His direction as we seek to love others through our time and attention. It’s exciting to realize that if we’re willing to alter our plans, we may become vessels of His healing work.
