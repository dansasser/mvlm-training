Have you been so changed by Jesus’ love that you are willing to follow Him anywhere?
Yesterday, we explored the glorious truth that no one is beyond God’s reach. His love can rescue anyone, no matter how far the person has fallen. Along those lines, let’s consider Saul of Tarsus, who was later known as the apostle Paul. On the road to Damascus, which Saul walked while “still breathing threats and murder against the disciples” (Acts 9:1), he met the Savior, and everything changed.
Jesus called him by name, saying, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?” (v. 4). But the persecutor couldn’t respond by addressing the Lord, because he didn’t yet know Christ. He didn’t have to wait long, however. “I am Jesus whom you are persecuting,” the Lord told the soon-to-be apostle (v. 5). And it was then that the great work began. Paul began “proclaim[ing] Jesus in the synagogues” and “proving that this Jesus is the Christ” (vv. 20, 22).
In John 10:27, Jesus said, “My sheep listen to My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.” The knowing between the Savior and His servant became so deep that Paul, the “chosen instrument,” bore Christ’s name “before the Gentiles” and “suffer[ed] in behalf” of it (Acts 9:15-16).
Paul listened. He knew the voice of his Savior, and he followed. May we do the same.
