Bringing Others to Jesus
We all have unique personalities and different opportunities, but each of us can share Jesus with someone.
The disciple Andrew is known for bringing people to Jesus. Immediately after meeting the Lord, he found his brother Simon and introduced him (John 1:41-42). Later, when a great multitude was hungry, he found a boy with five loaves and two fish and brought him to Jesus (John 6:8-9). And when some Greeks wanted to meet Christ, Andrew and Philip made the introductions (John 12:20-22). The disciple’s actions show that he clearly saw the importance of knowing the Savior.
By asking “Rabbi, where are You staying?” (John 1:38-39), Andrew was making a request to spend time with Jesus and learn from Him. The disciple’s example is a good reminder that sweet fellowship with the Lord isn’t limited to devotional times. Rather, it should stimulate a desire to share with others the joy we find in our relationship with Christ. And just as Andrew wasn’t shy about connecting others with the Messiah, we should be ready to do likewise anytime the situation presents itself.
When Andrew answered the call to discipleship, Jesus told him he’d be catching men instead of fish (Matthew 4:18-19). As followers of Christ, we also have this same wondrous goal. Our styles, personalities, and opportunities to do so may vary, but we’re each tasked with bringing others to Jesus.
