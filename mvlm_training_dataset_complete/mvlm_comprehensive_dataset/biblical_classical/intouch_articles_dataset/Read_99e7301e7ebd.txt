Ask God to help you live freely and purposefully.
As we saw yesterday, God wants us to reach His goals for our life, but we also have an enemy who would like to prevent that. If we know what the roadblocks are, it is easier to recognize and overcome them.
Scripture identifies potential obstacles to watch for:
• Fear causes our focus to shift from Jesus to the very thing we want to avoid. The antidote is to refocus on God.
• Doubt is a lack of assurance that the Lord will help us to succeed. Past failures, negative influences, and ignorance of His Word can all lead to this obstacle.
• Excuses are an effort to make disobedience more comfortable. We must be careful to avoid false justifications like Adam’s complaint that Eve was to blame for his bad decision (Genesis 3:12). God always gives what we need in order to obey Him.
• Laziness and procrastination inhibit success. These related behaviors can prevent our achieving God’s purpose.
Wise people check their conduct to identify anything that might hinder following Christ fully.  Ask God for strength to make changes that will help you live freely and purposefully in the way He has planned.
