Through the Bible, God speaks personally to His children.
The Bible is the most amazing book ever written. God used human beings to record His thoughts and words in writing so that others could know Him (2 Peter 1:20-21). The One who spoke the universe into existence still speaks just as powerfully through the pages of the Bible that you hold in your hands.
At the moment of salvation, believers receive the Holy Spirit, and lines of communication with the Lord are established. Then, whenever the Scriptures are read, children of God can hear His voice, and the Spirit enables them to understand and put into practice what they have heard.
The Bible isn’t just a good book that’s filled with comforting words; Scripture is effective and always achieves God’s purpose (Isaiah 55:10-11). Today’s passage describes it as “active and alive,” and 1 Thessalonians 2:13 tells us the Word of God is “at work in you who believe.” This book has the power to change our life if we will believe the Lord and do what He says.
God uses the Bible to transform us from the inside out. Before reading Scripture, ask Him to help you hear and understand what He’s saying. As you believe and obey, your spiritual hearing will become more acute, and your time in the Word will become an intimate conversation with the Lord.
