The Holy Spirit will transform us—from the inside out.
Who doesn’t enjoy accomplishments? Most of us like being recognized for our achievements, whether it’s landing a big client at work, winning the chili cook-off, or training a baby to sleep all night. These are all good things, but God’s purpose for us is so much deeper. Galatians 5:22-23 tells us that our character is important to God. That’s why He instructs us to walk by the Spirit, so that the deeds of the flesh are replaced with God’s attributes.
Love is the foundation for all other virtues. We cultivate it by embracing God’s unconditional love for us.
Joy is contentment regardless of our circumstances.
Peace comes from trusting God and surrendering to Him.
Patience is developed by trusting God’s perfect timing.
Kindness is God’s compassion reflected to others.
Goodness occurs as we mirror His righteousness and justice.
Faithfulness means we are steadfast and trustworthy.
Gentleness comes when we approach others with humility.
Self-control requires us to exercise restraint and rely on the Holy Spirit’s strength.
Growing in these virtues makes us more Christlike and testifies to God’s transformative work in our life. And that’s an accomplishment worth celebrating.
