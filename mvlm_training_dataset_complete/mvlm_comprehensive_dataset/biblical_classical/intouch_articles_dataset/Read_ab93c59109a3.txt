Wisdom’s Benefit Package
What happens when we seek to live according to God's wisdom?
When someone is interviewing for a new job, it’s common to ask, “What does the benefits package include?” We’d do well to consider a similar question about the value of living according to God’s wisdom: “What are the advantages of obedience to the instructions given in the Bible?” Two important benefits are:
1. In seeking God’s wisdom, we will acquire a deeper understanding and knowledge of Him. (See Prov. 2:4-6.) Our perspective on life is greatly enhanced when we have a close relationship with the Father. He’ll give us the ability to see ourselves, others, and circumstances the way He views them. As biblical principles permeate our minds, they begin to shape our thinking and responses to all of life’s challenges.
2. The Lord promises to guide and protect us if we walk wisely (vv. 7-10). Nothing outside His will can penetrate the shield of protection around those who love and seek to obey Him. When we let His wisdom enter our heart, discretion watches over our desires and emotions (vv. 11-20).
Godly understanding and protection come to people who seek divine wisdom. If you receive the words of Scripture and let them fill your heart and mind, the Lord will reveal Himself to you and give you His discernment.
