God’s Love Comforts Us
Jesus went to the cross and died in our place so that we could become children of God.
Our heavenly Father wants us to know how much He loves and cares for us. In fact, today’s passage says that nothing can separate us from His love. He has made this clear through:
• Revelation of Himself. In Scripture, we learn that God made us in His image and has a purpose for us. Sin separated us from Him, but He has a solution to our problem.
• Provision of a Savior. We were trapped by our sinful nature and under a sentence of eternal death—separation from God forever. But because of our Father’s great love for us, He sent His only Son to bear the penalty we deserved (Romans 6:23). Jesus rescued us from sin and reconciled us to the Father. What we could never do for ourselves, He did for us.
• Adoption of Believers. When we place trust in Jesus Christ as our Savior, we become children of God. The separation between us and Him is gone; instead of being enemies, we are family. The indwelling Holy Spirit serves as both evidence that we belong to God and assurance of His unending love.
The Father’s care for us shines brightly through the cross—it was because of love that He sent Jesus to earth to die in our place (1 John 4:9-10). Once we accept the gift of salvation through Christ, nothing can separate us from God’s love. What a comfort that is in times of need.
