When there’s a scary situation, place your focus on and your trust in Jesus.
People feel afraid of different things for different reasons. Some have phobias about heights, spiders, or public speaking. Others worry about the future—If I lose my job or get sick, will my loved ones be okay? Still others fear failure—What if I disappoint my parents or my boss? Fear can paralyze us, obstructing the abundant life Jesus promised in John 10:10. It can also tempt us to question God and wonder if we can trust Him.
The Bible contains dozens of verses urging us to have courage and not be afraid, but many of us struggle because we’re attempting to be brave on our own. What truly gives us freedom from fear is Jesus living in us.
When David, a young shepherd boy, faced the Philistine champion Goliath (1 Samuel 17:1-58), he toppled the giant—but not because he had confidence in his weapons, strength, or aim. Rather, he knew that God was mighty and good. David was victorious because he placed his trust in the Lord, and that’s why fear had no hold on him.
What would your life look like if you refused to let fear define you and instead fully embraced the “power and love and self-discipline” the Holy Spirit gives (2 Timothy 1:7)? Try taking a step in that direction today.
