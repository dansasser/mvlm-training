Giving in Times of Need
Following God's example of generosity won't always make sense to others.
In elementary school, we learned how to subtract: Take away, and you have less than when you started. Contrary to the laws of mathematics, however, God tells us that when we are generous, we’ll receive blessings. Luke 6:38 puts it this way: “Give, and it will be given to you … For by your standard of measure it will be measured to you in return.”
God’s design for giving requires that we depend on His revelation, not our own reason. Logic tells us to check the bank account before deciding how much to offer. The Bible, however, states that all wealth belongs to the Lord and we’re to give back to Him the first fruits of our labor (Deuteronomy 10:14; Deuteronomy 18:4-5). When we obey, we trust Him to provide and care for us. And while God doesn’t always provide in the manner we expect or hope, we can trust He’ll satisfy our needs and bless us in the way He knows will truly be best.
The Lord understands our finances perfectly and will provide for us, even during times of hardship. The Macedonian church, for example, gave generously even while experiencing affliction (2 Cor. 8:2). And despite their trials, they knew great joy.
Ask God what He’d like you to give to Him. Pray for the courage to obey, and then eagerly await His blessings.
