The Beauty of the Yoke
The difficulties of this life are opportunities to walk closely with our Savior and know Him better.
Jesus invites all burdened individuals to come to Him for rest, yet so often we misunderstand what He is asking of us. We can’t just dump our problems on the Lord and walk away unchanged. Using an agricultural image, He asks us to join Him in the “yoke” so we can walk and work together. In other words, He doesn’t want just our burdens; He wants us!
The yoke of Christ is a symbol of discipleship, characterized by submission and obedience to Him. God’s goal isn’t simply to remove a weighty trial or affliction; He longs to draw us to Himself in a close and trusting relationship. Remember, the “yoke is comfortable” and the “burden is light” when our Savior is helping us bear it (v. 30). That’s why those who take Him up on His offer will experience an amazing transformation.
The process of sharing the load begins with learning to know and understand the Lord. The burden is not necessarily removed, but the weight of the affliction shifts from our shoulders to His. Life’s pressures may not lessen, but if we are intimately linked with Jesus, our soul will be free from anxiety, and His peace will rule in our heart.
