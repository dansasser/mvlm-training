Praying With Authority
God always listens to His children and responds—with power and wisdom.
God has given us the privilege of calling on Him for all we need— what’s more, He’s promised to respond. He also encourages us to petition Him on behalf of others. And Scripture tells us that the prayers of a righteous person can accomplish much (James 5:16).
To pray powerfully, we must first accept God’s offer of salvation. Before redemption, we were unrighteous people under His judgment. But through faith in Jesus, we are made new and declared holy. Second, we must align our prayers with His will.
Let’s look at Elijah. The Lord sent him to defeat and humiliate the evil king Ahab and the 450 prophets of Baal. This was a spiritual conflict to prove who was the real God—Baal or the Lord of Israel.
Elijah’s weapons were his knowledge of the Father’s plan and the authority he had in prayer as a prophet of God. His request that Jehovah would make Himself known—voiced publicly before his opponents—matched the Lord’s will (Exodus 7:5; 1 Kings 18:37). And when God responded to Elijah’s prayer, the people declared, “The Lord, He is God” (v. 39).
Are you a child of God? If so, you can pray with spiritual might by making sure your requests are in agreement with His will.
