How to Receive God’s Guidance
Are you ready to hear from the Lord?
For life’s countless decisions, it’s important to seek guidance from our all-knowing and all-wise God. Here are three steps for us to remember:
Cleansing. We ask the Lord to reveal any sin that might interfere with what He wants to tell us, and then we confess it. He has promised to forgive when we do (Psalm 66:18;1 John 1:9).
Surrender. Our Father won’t share His plans for our life until we are committed to following Him no matter what. Scripture says the Lord hears and grants our petitions when they align with His will (1 John 5:14-15). As we yield ourselves to Him, we’ll find the way to the right request and the best possible answer.
Meditation. Since God often leads believers to an answer through His Word, we must spend time in it. Our reading may take us to a chapter that deals with our very situation or to a passage containing an applicable principle. The key is to believe the Lord is guiding and then to act in faith (Mark 11:24).
God wants us to keep in mind that waiting is important—the process of seeking guidance can be slow, and running ahead or manipulating circumstances could lead to a costly mistake. But He will act on behalf of those who wait for Him (Isaiah 64:4). So seek direction and you’ll receive it. That’s a promise.
