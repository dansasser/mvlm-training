Obedience, humility, and service result when we are devoted to the Lord.
Having been saved by faith in Christ, we express our love and gratitude through devotion to Him. Bible study and prayer should be an integral part of our daily routine. In addition, our commitment to the Lord is demonstrated through a passion to obey, a spirit of humility, and a heart for service—things David modeled well.
Obedience.  Although David lived imperfectly, his desire was to obey the Lord, and he sought to do so his whole life. We see in John 14:15 that obedience should be our goal as well: Jesus said, “If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.”
Humility. After killing Goliath, David was taken into the king’s service and put in charge of the men of war. Though the crowds shouted praise for him, he remained loyal to Saul and waited for God’s timing with regard to ascending the throne. Then, even as king, David remained humble. He knew what had been accomplished was due to God’s actions, not his own (2 Samuel 7:18).
Service. Not only as a lowly shepherd but also as a mighty king, David prioritized following and serving the Lord (Psalm 25:5). This man after God’s own heart was fully devoted to his Father.
David’s actions reflected His humble attitude of servanthood and a longing to please the Lord. Let his example encourage you to take steps each day to express commitment to Jesus.
