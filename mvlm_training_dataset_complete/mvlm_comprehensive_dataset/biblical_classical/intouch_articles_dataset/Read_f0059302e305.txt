How God Reveals Himself
If you want to know God better, make Bible study and prayer a habit.
Look at the delicate veins of an oak leaf, and you’ll experience the beauty of God. Watch a thrashing thunderstorm, and you witness His power. We need to look no further than nature to understand that God is real.
Paul tells us that the revelation of the Lord in nature is sufficient to render inexcusable those who would deny His existence (Rom. 1:20). But nature can’t give us a complete picture; that is why He gave us His Word. The Bible reveals God’s character and explains His expectations of the faithful. In its pages, we can learn about our Father and the kind of life He wants us to lead. As 2 Timothy 3:16 tells us, “All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness.”
Scripture teaches about the living Word—Jesus Christ—who is the fullest possible revelation of God. The heavenly Father wants humanity to know Him intimately, and to make that possible, He sent His Son clothed in flesh. Jesus said, “If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; from now on you know Him, and have seen Him” (John 14:7). So let the grandeur of creation point you to the Creator—and then, to know God better and better, spend time in His Word daily.
