Hindrances to Knowing God’s Will
Let God help you avoid these common obstacles to understanding His good and perfect will.
The Bible tells us God’s will is good, acceptable, and perfect in every way (Rom. 12:2). To live life at its spiritual best, we need to discover His plans and desires for us, and then we must walk in them every day. Yet certain hindrances can prevent us from discerning the Lord’s intentions for us:
Desire for control. We’re born into this world with a fallen nature. To follow God’s plan, we need to surrender our rights and embrace His ways. We must choose every day to let Him rule over our thought life, emotions, decisions, families, and work (Luke 9:23).
Ignorance of God’s principles. Without the light of biblical guidance, we’ll wander away from the Lord’s plan (Psalm 119:105).
Influence of others. People have lots of opinions about what we ought to do and how God would want us to behave. Unless we are extremely careful, we will act to satisfy them. Then we’ll end up out of God’s will because we put people’s preferences ahead of the Lord.
If we abandon ourselves to God’s care, then “self” will be subdued, a hunger for His Word will grow, and we will live to please Him, not others. Make it your goal to give the “throne of your life” over to Him.
