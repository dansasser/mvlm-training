Praying the Promises of God
The Bible is a firm foundation, so trust God's words and live boldly.
Jesus said we would endure many hardships. But God provided amazing tools to keep trials from overwhelming us. He placed His Spirit inside us to guide and empower. He gave us prayer so we could not only communicate and stay connected with Him but also bring Him our requests. Today let’s look at another of His marvelous gifts: the Bible.
Scripture is the Word of God Almighty. It is truth. It never changes. There are thousands of promises in the Bible—assurances that we can rely on with perfect confidence. And wise believers will turn His promises into prayers, which they express as the cry of their heart.
Let’s look at an example that relates to difficult decisions. Psalm 32:8 says, “I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you should go; I will counsel you with My eye upon you.” We can pray God’s words back to Him, saying we believe that He will teach us and reveal His path—and that He’ll remain by our side as our caregiver through the entire situation.
When hardships arise, we need a solid foundation. Otherwise, our emotions could easily lead us astray through faulty thinking. God is faithful and unchanging, so we can trust in His promises, which enable us to rest confidently and act boldly.
