There is always more to learn about the goodness of our Creator.
For us as believers, understanding as much as we can about the Lord deepens our relationship with Him. It also helps us to share our faith with others. With that in mind, let’s explore four attributes of almighty God.
1. He has the qualities of personhood. Mankind was created with the ability to feel, reason, and make decisions. And God has the capacity for emotion as well—Genesis 1:26 says we were made in His image. The Bible frequently makes mention of His feelings, like anger and love.
2. The Lord is spirit (John 4:23-24). Because of this, He has no limitations. He isn’t confined to a place, so we can worship Him anywhere. What’s more, His Holy Spirit indwells each believer, so we can enjoy His presence and guidance anytime (Psalm 66:18).
3. God is eternal (Isaiah 40:28). He always was, is now, and forever will be. Nothing existed before Him or will outlast Him.
4. Our Father is unchangeable (Malachi 3:6). His nature and attributes always remain constant. Yes, God experiences variety in emotions, but not in the essence of His character.
What a blessing that God would teach us about Himself through the Bible. Praise Him for His attributes, and continue seeking to know Him better through His Word.
