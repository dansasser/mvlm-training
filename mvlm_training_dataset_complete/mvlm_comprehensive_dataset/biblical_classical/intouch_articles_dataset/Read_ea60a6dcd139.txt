We know our requests align with God's will when they come directly from Scripture.
Today’s passage includes a life-changing prayer, written by Paul to the believers at Colossae. Here’s what makes this prayer so powerful: Every request is in agreement with God’s will.
In verse 9, Paul asked that the Colossians be filled with knowledge of what the Father desires from His children. The way this happens is by spending time with God—talking with Him, reading His Word, and seeking His will. It includes His general purposes for all believers—such as loving Him and people (Luke 10:27)—as well as His specific plan for each one of us (Ephesians 2:10).
Paul knew that to apply what we learn, we need insight and clarity, which come from the Holy Spirit (John 16:13). So he asked God to give the believers at Colossae spiritual wisdom and understanding. But this is also a request we can make for those who don’t yet know Christ. After all, it’s not God’s desire for any to perish (2 Peter 3:9), and people need spiritual understanding in order to come to faith.
Our heavenly Father has promised that those who pray in agreement with His purposes will receive what they ask. Therefore, it is important to start by discovering what His plans are. Try incorporating scriptural prayers—like the one from today’s passage—into your conversations with the Lord.
