The Consequences of Anger
Holding on to our anger doesn’t accomplish God’s will; instead, it destroys us and poisons others.
When’s the last time you were angry, and how did you respond? We all get agitated at one point or another—even God Himself feels anger. However, because we’re human, we don’t always respond in the best way. Ephesians 4:26 tells us, “Be angry, and yet do not sin.”
One way we often sin is by holding on to anger. When resentment takes up residence in our heart, it twists our thinking and emotions and robs us of peace. Then that bitterness can spill over into our relationships. We might speak hurtful words, even at those who aren’t the cause of the rage. Or we might pull away in self-protection to avoid future hurts.
While clinging to anger can damage our personal well-being and connection with others, an even more serious outcome is hindered fellowship with the Lord. A negative attitude hardens our heart and affects God’s work in and through us. It also grieves Him. Our Father wants to shower us with joy and peace, but angry hearts interfere with such blessings.
Are you harboring anger? Unresolved bitterness could be buried so deep within your soul that you might not even realize it’s there. Feeling anger occasionally is normal, but clinging to negativity is destructive. Ask God to reveal any hidden resentment. Release it to Him and take hold of the riches of Christ.
