Promises and Expectations
Serving God may not always look like what we expect, but we can rest in His love and faithfulness.
In today’s passage, an angel brings good news to Manoah’s infertile wife: She would have a baby who’d be set apart for God’s service and bring deliverance to His people (vv. 1-5). After news like that, she probably imagined that her son’s life would be filled with holiness and happily-ever-afters. And in accordance with God’s plan, Manoah and his wife taught Samson to follow the strict guidelines of the Nazirite vow of dedication. (See Numbers 6:1-21.)
But Samson’s life didn’t turn out the way his parents may have dreamed. Though blessed with a godly upbringing and incredible physical strength, he got involved with women from pagan countries. And he confessed to Delilah, a Philistine woman he loved, the secret of his strength: It was related to the Nazirite vow, which included that “no razor shall pass over his head” (v. 5). Delilah betrayed him by cutting his hair and turning him over to the Philistines. Yet God was at work in all this: In his final moments, Samson regained his strength and fulfilled the promise of deliverance.
The faithfulness of Samson’s parents is a reminder that we can’t predict how events will unfold but must nevertheless hold tightly to God’s promises. Even though our story might not look like what we expect, we can trust that the Lord loves us and is able to work everything for His glory.
