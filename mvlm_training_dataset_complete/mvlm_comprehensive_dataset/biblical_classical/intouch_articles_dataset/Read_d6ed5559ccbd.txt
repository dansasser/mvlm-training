When we seek to live according to God's Word, He provides all we need and acts on our behalf.
Daniel and his friends were in a strange land, prisoners of a king who sought to benefit from their superior skills and intellect. As he grew to manhood, Daniel managed to operate within the foreign system without compromising his belief in the heavenly Father. He did not eat forbidden foods. He maintained his prayer times, even in the face of punishment. And God honored Daniel’s obedience and faithfulness, rescuing him from the lions’ den and blessing him with great favor. At every crossroads, Daniel chose to follow the Lord. He still had to endure trying situations, but God was ever faithful in His protection and provision.
The biblical principles in effect during the Babylonian captivity still hold true. God promises to make secure those who obey His Word. He doesn’t promise that we will avoid hard times, but He does say that He’ll be with us every step of the way (Matthew 28:20).
If you know there is sin in your life, fear and doubt are certain to follow. However, obedience is the way to find courage and contentment, regardless of your circumstances. Daniel refused to change his principles, and God intervened every single time. He will also act on your behalf.
