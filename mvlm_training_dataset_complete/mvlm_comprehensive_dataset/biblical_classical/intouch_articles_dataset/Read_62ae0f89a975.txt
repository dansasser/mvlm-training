Peace in Troubled Times
In difficult times, remember God’s past faithfulness and choose to trust Him.
Faced with the certain defeat of his nation, King Jehoshaphat responded with worship. In fact, read today’s passage and you may find it difficult to separate the petition from the praise.
The king led the people in glorifying God for their past redemption. As they focused on the Lord, the Israelites recalled anew how their heavenly Father had intervened in the past. This was exactly what God had told them to do—to instruct their children regularly about His ways (Deuteronomy 6:7) so their lives would honor Him. That, in turn, builds courage and strengthens faith.
The people’s praise paved the way for their total dependence upon God. The odds of the small Israelite army beating the united force of three enemies were slim. However, in their worshipful state of mind, the people could admit their weakness and await divine intervention. God gave them an outrageous solution to the problem: Do nothing. Israel was spiritually prepared to go against human reason and obeyed His command.
God is also willing to lead you to victory in troubled times. The Israelites’ story is recorded in His Word so that all believers may apply its principles to their lives. Bend your heart and mind toward the Lord, and He will enlarge your vision of who He is and what He can do on your behalf.
