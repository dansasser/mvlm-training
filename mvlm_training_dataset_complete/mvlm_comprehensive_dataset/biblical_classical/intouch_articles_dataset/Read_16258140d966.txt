God's forgiveness is complete, permanent, and always available.
The Parable of the Prodigal Son is a beautiful picture of the grace God showers on us when we repent and turn to Him. In this story, the father has been greatly disrespected by his younger son but continues to wait patiently for him to come home. Finally, as the young man is returning, the father runs to meet him and orders the servants to prepare a feast. His eagerness to celebrate his child’s return exemplifies how God stands ready to receive us when we head toward Him. It also provides a perfect model for how we’re to show grace to the prodigals in our own lives.
This illustration of God’s character underscores Paul’s assertion to the Ephesians: “In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our wrongdoings, according to the riches of His grace which He lavished on us” (Ephesians 1:7-8). When we turn to God, He showers His grace on us. He doesn’t forgive our sins begrudgingly or keep a record of our wrongs. He offers complete redemption that leads to new life.
Do you need that kind of grace today? Know that God stands ready to immerse you in it (John 1:16-17). Or perhaps you need to offer it to someone in your life. Let the image of the forgiving father in today’s passage be a reminder of the grace God calls us to extend every day.
