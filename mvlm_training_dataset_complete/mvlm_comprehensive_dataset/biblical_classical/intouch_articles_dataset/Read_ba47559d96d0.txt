The Holy Spirit will release power when we choose to obey our Father's call.
Paul frequently wrote about the need to rely on Christ’s strength. He shared a promise the Lord had given him: “My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness” (2 Corinthians 12:9). Paul was a great Christian leader, but in God’s eyes, he was no more deserving of grace than any other person. We can have the same confidence in the Lord’s power that the apostle had.
When Paul received Jesus as his Lord and Savior, he was adopted as God’s son. His sins were forgiven, and he received the Holy Spirit (Acts 13:9), so he could begin his work for the Lord’s service (Galatians 1:15).
Consider Paul’s jail time. To help him endure imprisonment, the Holy Spirit provided physical and mental stamina. And at the same time, He burdened the hearts of other believers to provide for Paul’s needs (Philippians 4:18). Most importantly, God’s Spirit gave him the courage to speak of Jesus Christ with his Roman guards (Philippians 1:13).
Paul relied upon God for strength and consequently never gave up on his faith. We serve the same all-powerful God, which means we have no excuse for running away from His plan, either. His Spirit dwells in us and is ready to release power when we obey our Father’s call.
