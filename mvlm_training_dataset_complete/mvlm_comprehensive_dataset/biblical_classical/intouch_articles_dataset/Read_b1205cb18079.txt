Building Muscles of Faith
Do you want a stronger faith? Each day is an opportunity to practice trusting God.
Have you ever wished for stronger faith? Faith is like a muscle, which must be exercised in order to become strong.
As Christians, we are to trust in God for everything, not just for salvation (Proverbs 3:5-6). The growth of faith is a process that involves increasing degrees of trust throughout life. Weak faith hopes that God will do what He says, but strong faith knows He is faithful to accomplish all He says He will do.
Elijah was a man of great faith who saw challenges as opportunities for God to work. The prophet also believed in the Father’s supernatural ability. So can you. The Lord may not do every miraculous thing you ask, but He does some extraordinary work in and through each person who trusts in Him and is obedient.
You may think you’re not good enough for God to use you, but the Bible is filled with examples of flawed people whom God selected for service. He isn’t looking for perfection, but for people who believe in and rely on Him. He doesn’t simply work through people of faith; He transforms them (Romans 12:1-2).
Start by reading God’s Word to learn His will. Each day is an opportunity to grow in this area. Ask the Lord to show you verses that apply to your circumstances. If you follow His lead, your faith muscles will grow, and He will be glorified.
