God’s Condition for His Full Blessing
It’s your choice: Will you trust Christ enough to accept His will for your life?
The Lord wants to give each of us an abundance of blessings. Today’s passage clarifies the one necessary condition for receiving His best: surrender. Every aspect of our being—body, soul, and spirit—is to be a living sacrifice.
In the Old Testament, sacrifice was commonplace. To atone for sin, a person could bring an animal to the altar. It was set apart for God’s purposes as a holy offering, and through its death, restitution was made.
When we give ourselves as a sacrifice, there is, thankfully, no need for our blood to be shed. Jesus died to atone for all of our sin. So, out of love and gratitude, every aspect of our life should be dedicated to Him.
What does a surrendered life entail? Most importantly, it involves commitment to Christ. God’s Spirit guides us, and His will is the goal. Yielding to Him means following His way in attitude, words, thoughts, and deeds—and doing so unapologetically, unwaveringly, and fearlessly.
Complete surrender is not an easy road; it means dying to your desires and selfishness. But remember that the Lord is willing and able to do more than we can ever imagine (Ephesians 3:20).
