How to Bear One Another’s Burdens
Trust the Holy Spirit to show you how to help people around you who are suffering.
Our quiet presence during someone else’s time of pain says more than any advice ever could. Think about the times that we bring our burdens before the Lord in prayer. Simply experiencing His presence lightens the weight we have been carrying. God’s response to our pain is a clear demonstration of how important it is to make ourselves available to our neighbors.
The Holy Spirit will let us know when words are not necessary—and when they are. As we give the Holy Spirit total control, He will bring to mind situations, emotions, and the ways God has helped us. We can use those remembrances to minister to others: Hurting people grab onto kindred stories like a lifeline. It gives them hope to reason that since the Lord shepherded one person through a valley of darkness, He will surely be faithful to do the same for another.
Our Spirit-developed compassion may require us to give our neighbor other types of help—perhaps by delivering a meal, offering a ride, or providing financial assistance. It’s good to pray for a friend or share an encouraging testimony with a church member, but we shouldn’t limit our ministry to those things. If we’re willing to be used by our heavenly Father, we must be open to His leading about how to love our neighbors (John 13:34).
