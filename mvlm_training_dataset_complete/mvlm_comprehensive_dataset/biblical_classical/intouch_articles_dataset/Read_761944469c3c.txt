Gathering to celebrate God’s goodness honors Him and blesses us.
When the Israelites entered the Promised Land after years of wandering in the desert, God issued a strange command: Feast.
Feasting and enjoying the bounty of the land were meant to tie the Israelites to different rhythms throughout the year—such as harvesting the first and last of the year’s crops. Festivals were also a way of commemorating the mighty acts of God on the people’s behalf, like the night of the Passover when God spared all who’d painted their doors with the blood of a lamb. Ultimately, these celebrations were an act of worship that reoriented God’s people to right relationship with Him. God was their provider and sustainer, so they feasted with gratitude. He was their rescuer and redeemer, so they feasted in holy remembrance.
Today we can learn healthy spiritual habits from these observances prescribed by God for the ancient Israelites. When we pause to give thanks for our blessings, we worship God with our time and attention. When we gather to simply enjoy His good gifts, we remember that “every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above” (James 1:17)—not from our own striving.
When was the last time you paused to savor God’s goodness, remember His faithfulness, and worship Him? Consider taking time to taste and see the goodness of God today.
