Jesus died on the cross to take the punishment we deserved for our wrongs.
Scripture has a variety of titles for Jesus—Messiah, Lord, Christ, Rabbi, Teacher—but the one that is probably least familiar to the modern world is the Lamb of God. Most of us have a limited understanding of the history and culture of the Jewish people, so we may not truly understand this designation. But the Israelites of that day understood its significance: Lambs were for sacrifice.
God has always dealt with transgression through sacrifices. For example, when Adam and Eve sinned, an animal was slain to cover their nakedness and shame (Genesis 3:21). Later, on the first Passover, each household covered the doorway with sacrificial blood (Exodus 12:1-7). After that, a goat was slaughtered for the atonement of the entire nation (Leviticus 16:15). Then, in John 1:29, we see the ultimate sacrifice—the Lamb who takes away the sins of the world.
Just as innocent animals had died in place of the guilty, so Christ gave His perfect life for sinful mankind. He assumed full responsibility for all our sins and took the punishment that we deserved. As He hung on the cross, the judgment and wrath of God was poured out on Him instead of on us. Let’s praise and thank Him for this gift.
