The Believer’s Valley Experiences
We don't have to be afraid in times of trouble, because our kind and strong Father is always with us.
Where there are mountains, there must also be valleys—it’s a simple fact of the created world. The same is true in our spiritual life. To reach the place where God is leading us, we must sometimes traverse “the valley of the shadow of death” (Ps. 23:4).
Spiritual mountaintops are wonderful spots to rest, but it is in valleys that we often discover God’s character, the truth of His promises, and our own weakness. Valleys reveal that the habits and crutches we’ve been relying on are inadequate—and we must trust God instead. That’s when we come to find out that faith, courage, and wisdom are rooted in the Lord.
While walking in valleys is an inevitable and difficult part of life, believers aren’t left comfortless. Verse 5 says, “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You have anointed my head with oil; my cup overflows.” These words are about having our needs met, including the desire to be soothed. In David’s image of a tender shepherd rubbing oil on an animal’s scraped skin, God promises us assurance, healing, and safety—even in hardship.
Facing the shadows is difficult and frightening work. But when we surrender to the Lord, we can rest in His power and comfort.
