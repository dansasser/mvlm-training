Giving the Worthy Gift
A relationship with the Lord means we have the opportunity for great joy in giving.
When David wanted to build an altar to the Lord, Araunah the Jebusite wanted to give him land, oxen, and all the items he would need. But David knew burnt offerings that cost him nothing wouldn’t be an acceptable sacrifice to the Lord.
Likewise, God’s sacrifice of His Son wasn’t free; in fact, it was extremely costly. We often hear about God’s grace as a gift freely given to us. And while it’s true we don’t have to pay, it came at a very high price.
In response to God’s generous gift, we should offer Him our best gifts as well. Frequently, however, we fall short and simply go through the motions—serving dutifully but remaining unengaged. Or it could mean reserving our best energy for ourselves or others. We might even set God on the shelf for later, thinking we’ll get back to Him when we have a minute. But it’s easy for time to get away from us before we make good on our intentions.
In what way do you feel God inviting you to give Him your time? What does it look like to give Him your affection? Is there some part of your life that the Lord is yearning for you to share with Him? Let us be like David and give God our best, not just what’s left over.
