Communication with the Lord is a vital part of the Christian life.
Prayer is a common practice for believers, but we can easily lose sight of its greater purpose—communing with God and discerning His will for our life. Because communication with Him is so vital, it’s wise to step back at times and ask yourself these questions:
What are my prayers accomplishing in me? Does praying make you feel closer to the Lord or is it more of a “have to”?
Who am I praying for? Are most of your requests for yourself or others?
What am I asking God to do? Have you looked in His Word to see what He wants, or are you trying to get Him to intervene according to your plans and desires?
When do I pray? Do you call on the Lord only during emergencies or when you need something?
If you discovered any selfishness in your answers, you’re not alone. Most of us struggle to enter God’s presence with our eyes focused solely on Him. Your prayer life can become energizing and potent if you approach the Lord with a clean heart (Psalm 66:18), align your requests with His will (John 14:13), and believe He will do what He says (Numbers 23:19). We won’t be able to do these things perfectly, but the more we try, the more confident we’ll be in our prayers to God.”
