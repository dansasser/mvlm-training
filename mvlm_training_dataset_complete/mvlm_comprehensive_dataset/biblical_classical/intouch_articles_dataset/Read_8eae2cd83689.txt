Do You Want to Hear God Better?
As we grow more and more like Christ, our spiritual discernment improves.
2 Corinthians 3:17-18
Our ability to hear the Lord is directly related to our relationship with Him. Yes, once we receive Christ as Savior, we have been granted salvation and are eternally secure in Him. But God wants us to grow stronger in our faith by constantly drawing closer to Him over the course of our life.
This continual process of growing in Christlikeness gives us greater clarity and discernment, so when we pray, we’re not talking to some distant, cold deity. Instead, we are conversing with the God who loves, sustains, and molds us throughout our life (2 Corinthians 3:17-18). By being “conformed to the image of His Son,” we also learn to understand God’s “language” and speak it more fluently.
That changes how we approach Him, doesn’t it? We can come to Him boldly and joyfully, confident in our relationship with the heavenly Father, assured that He loves us, forgives us, and rejoices in our prayers.
When we have unimpeded fellowship with the Father, we hear Him better. As we grow closer to Him, our spiritual discernment continues to improve. Through Jesus, we can have unimaginable clarity and intimacy in our two-way communication with almighty God.
