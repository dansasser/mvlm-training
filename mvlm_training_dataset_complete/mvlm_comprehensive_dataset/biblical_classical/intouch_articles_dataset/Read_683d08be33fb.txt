The Need for Patience
A calm response is a reflection of Christ and something that builds others’ trust in us.
On a weekly if not daily basis, we are likely to experience some situation or other that requires patience. Let’s consider several reasons to develop this spiritual fruit:
Our Calling. We’re called to live a life worthy of God, characterized by humility, gentleness, and patience (Ephesians 4:1-3).
Biblical Teaching. Scripture tells us to be tolerant of one another, bearing each other’s burdens and responding with kindness (Galatians 6:1-2).
Jesus’ Example. Christ demonstrated patience toward the crowds’ demands, Peter’s hotheaded actions, and the leaders’ false accusations (Matthew 12:1-4). We are to cultivate a similar attitude and act with love.
Healthy Relationships. Responding calmly creates peaceful, trustworthy bonds with others.
God’s Approval. Paul wrote that we’re to be joyful in hope and patient in affliction (Rom. 12:12 NIV). When we quietly endure our suffering, we find favor with God (1 Peter 2:20).
The Holy Spirit is conforming us to Christ’s image. As we cooperate, He will develop our ability to persevere calmly no matter the situation. A peaceful demeanor is a powerful witness to the transforming work of God.
