God is faithful to deliver those who trust Him for help.
Have you ever carried a heavy object for so long that your arms start to burn from its weight? You count the steps until you can finally set it down, and when you do, relief floods your body as the pain subsides. We can feel something similar in our spirit when we surrender our burdens to the Lord.
David understood this kind of relief well. With his enemies in relentless pursuit, he was forced to hide to save his life. The weight he carried was evident as he cried out in distress, “How long, Lord? Will You forget me forever?” (Psalm 13:1). Yet, through his extended season of challenges, David experienced God’s faithfulness as well as His consolation in the anguish.
Remembering that God is faithful will bring release from the weight of our worries. So let’s hold to the perspective that God is at work and keep our eyes fixed on the solution rather than the problems. Then, like David, we will be able to say, “I will not be greatly shaken” (62:2).
While you are learning to release your burdens, be sure to talk to God in prayer (Psalm 62:8) and wait in hope for Him (Psalm 62:5). And never forget that He is your rock and salvation (Psalm 62:2). That is true relief.
