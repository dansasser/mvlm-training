Walking With Greater Confidence
Even the small steps we make to follow God strengthen our faith.
It’s the Lord’s desire that we walk by faith. Yet if we each consider our life honestly, most of us will find a number of areas where it’s a struggle to trust Him.
Thankfully, our heavenly Father is patient and loving. His Word clearly teaches that sanctification is the process of making us holy, not just the end result. Children are a great illustration of how this works. When toddlers learn to walk, they start by pulling up on something, standing, and then taking a step. At first, they inevitably fall, at which point we help them back up so they can keep progressing. In the same way, God shows us how to live according to our faith in Him, but we’ll make mistakes. Falling and getting up again are part of the learning process (John 21:15-17).
The Holy Spirit teaches us, but our responsibility is to study Scripture in order to get to know God’s nature and learn His promises. As we do these things, our confidence in Him grows, and we lean on Him more.
Consider the responses, actions, and decisions you’ve made in the past few days. How many of those were led by the Spirit? Living on the basis of trust in Christ requires belief and action. As you allow Him to lead, faith will grow.
