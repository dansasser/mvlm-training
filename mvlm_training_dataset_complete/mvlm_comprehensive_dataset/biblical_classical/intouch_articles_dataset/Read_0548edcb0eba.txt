Intergenerational Faith
How are you helping others know the Lord you love?
What a life Moses lived! By Pharaoh’s decree, he should have been killed at birth. Instead, thanks to God’s intervention and the faithful disobedience of the midwives and Moses’ mother and sister, the future leader didn’t just survive. He was adopted by Pharaoh’s daughter and raised as a prince. Then his story took another turn: Moses himself chose faithful disobedience, siding with his countrymen and fighting against Pharaoh for their liberation from slavery. Later, after decades of wandering in the wilderness, Israel’s sojourn was nearly at an end—and so were Moses’ days on earth. His life story, though spectacular, was never simply about him; it was about intergenerational faith in God.
Before Joshua was commissioned as the new leader, Moses recorded the book of the Law so it could regularly be read to the people; he also wrote down a song that would echo in their hearts and minds for generations (Deut. 31:9-11, 21-22). As a result, Israelites who never met Moses would know the God who went before them and to whom they belonged.
Wherever you are in your life or ministry—starting out, midway, or wrapping up your work—do you remember the God who says, “I have called you by name; you are Mine!” (Isaiah 43:1)? Are you both receiving and passing down His blessings?
