Do You Want God’s Best?
Surrender everything to the Lord to discover the blessings He longs to pour into your life.
The other day, we looked at Psalm 37:4 and read that God promises to give us the desires of our hearts. Today, let’s also look at the surrounding verses. This passage is one many people take out of context, forgetting the role they play.
What is our responsibility when it comes to claiming this promise from God? We must …
Delight ourselves in the Lord (v. 4). As Christians, we should rejoice in God. He deserves top priority in our life.
Commit our way to Him (v. 5). We must allow God to change any aspect of our ambition that is not aligned with His will. It’s good to remember that when He doesn’t answer prayers as we wish, it’s for a reason.
Trust in Him (v. 5). God is merciful, all-knowing, kind, and generous. We can trust Him with our hopes and dreams.
Rest in Him (v. 7). Resting in the Lord means being at peace with His care and control in your life.
Wait patiently upon him (v. 7). Jesus waited decades before beginning His ministry. Like Him, we should be patient.
Remember, the Lord longs to give His followers fullness of joy (Psalm 16:11) and abundant blessings “beyond all that we ask or think” (Ephesians 3:20). And when we surrender everything to Him, we’ll experience our Father’s best.
