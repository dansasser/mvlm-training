Faithfulness Through the Ages
We can read Scripture with expectation because God never fails to deliver on His promises.
God is the only One who never disappoints (1 Thessalonians 5:24). From the beginning of time, His Word has remained true. Every prophecy is a promise that has been—or will be—fulfilled.
Perhaps the greatest foretellings were those that told of the Messiah. In fact, many prophets spoke about the Anointed One (2 Samuel 7:12-16; Isaiah 7:14; Micah 5:2), though no new messianic prophecies were recorded during the four centuries leading up to Christ’s birth. Surely people questioned whether the Savior would ever come. After all, 400 years is a long time to wait. But when the time was right, Jesus came to reconcile mankind to the Father. God never falls short on His promises.
Knowing this, we can read Scripture’s assurances with expectation. For example, if we trust in Jesus as our Savior and choose to follow Him, the Bible promises our salvation. We are forgiven and redeemed, and nothing can separate us from God’s love (Romans 8:38-39). What’s more, we can trust that He will provide everything we need to accomplish His purpose for us.
Consider God’s faithfulness throughout history and in your own life, and know in your heart that He will be steadfast in the future as well. By living obediently, you can learn to trust that He will do all He has promised.
