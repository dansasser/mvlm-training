The Purpose of Spiritual Experiences
When needed, the Lord provides significant moments to build the faith we need to serve Him.
The Lord doesn’t let us experience tremendous spiritual moments simply so we may boast or witness something marvelous. Instead, He uses them to build genuine faith.
An exceptional encounter of this sort is intended to encourage our growth and deepen our intimacy with God. It is also designed to enhance our motivation to serve Him wholeheartedly, giving ourselves for His work and His glory without reservation.
The Lord has several purposes for such experiences: to reveal Himself in a fresh way, to prepare us for a valley, or to teach us to obey. The lessons we learn from Him in those special moments are intended to carry us through harder times. Then we will be able to look back and remember what He taught on the mountaintop. And in times of testing, our obedience will bring honor to God’s name (1 Peter 1:6-8).
The Lord may want to get your attention during times of profound worship, in a moment of deep devotion, or when you’re all alone, listening and intimately conversing with Him. Treasure the things He teaches you, whether they’re powerful revelations or more typical insights. If you allow yourself to be led to the path of obedience, He’ll take you to even greater heights.
