Remembering the mercy, grace, and power of God gives us confidence to ask for all we need.
We can learn valuable lessons from the prayers in the Old Testament. When Jehoshaphat petitioned for divine help, he struck a balance between asking the Lord to meet his needs and proclaiming God’s greatness. Likewise, our requests should be made with recognition of who God is. Otherwise, the focus of our prayers can become need, weakness, failure, or fear.
Jehoshaphat cried out to God about his terrible predicament, but he also exalted the Lord, acknowledging the great things He had done for the people of Israel. That’s why knowing the Word of God is so important (2 Timothy 3:16-17). When we read about how the Lord has worked in the lives of others, we better understand His awesome power. Then we can look to the men and women of the Old Testament as an example and begin to pray in a similar way. God’s wonder-working power is still available to us today, and He wants His children to access it.
By proclaiming, “Power and might are in Your hand so that no one can stand against You” (2 Chron. 20:6), Jehoshaphat was praising God and at the same time reminding himself of the Lord’s greatness. As you pray today, speak to God of His mercy, talk to Him about His grace, and recall His mighty power.
