God offers us the invaluable privilege of personal communication with Him.
Throughout human history, God has spoken to mankind in various ways. His prophets and apostles were moved by the Holy Spirit to proclaim and write His words (2 Peter 1:21), but His ultimate expression came through the birth of His Son Jesus (Galatians 4:3-5). Through the Holy Spirit, the Lord still communicates to every Christian who listens with an open and receptive heart.
Think about the wonder of having a God who speaks—not a distant deity who gives orders from heaven, but one who actually wants to converse with you! Why would the Lord of all creation choose to come to earth, die on a cross, and provide the Holy Spirit in order to communicate with each of us? Consider that God ...
Desires an intimate relationship with you.
Longs for you to trust Him and for your faith to grow strong as you see the fulfillment of His words.
Wants you to experience all He’s planned for your life—and will guide you to fulfill His purposes.
In the busyness of the Christmas season, it’s easy to take for granted this invaluable privilege of communication with the Lord. Take time this week away from distractions so you can listen to the God who wants to talk with you.
