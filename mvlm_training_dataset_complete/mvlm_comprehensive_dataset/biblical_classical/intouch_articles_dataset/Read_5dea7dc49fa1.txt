The Mission of Christ
Because of the Father’s great love, He sent Jesus to make a way for us to have eternal life.
Christ’s mission on earth was to do His Father’s will. Throughout His life, Jesus continually surrendered Himself to God. The King of kings came not to be served but to serve—even unto death (Matthew 20:28). His ultimate purpose was to become the sacrifice we needed: By means of His death on the cross, Jesus atoned for our sins so we could be reconciled to the Father.
To accomplish His mission, our Savior suffered greatly. But even in His darkest hour, He did not turn from His calling (Matthew 26:39). Ever the faithful Son, He gave us the only way to the Father and eternal life: Himself (John 14:6).
Jesus said that whoever has seen Him has seen the Father (John 14:9)—and that the two are in fact one (John 10:30). Today, He sits at the Father’s right hand, making intercession for us (Romans 8:34). One day He’ll return to judge sinners and reward the saints. To experience that, we must be prepared, and the only way to be prepared is to receive Jesus as our personal Savior and Lord.
Because the Father’s love for us is limitless, Jesus made it possible for every person to have eternal life. When you place faith in Christ as your Savior, you are united with the Father—now and throughout eternity.
