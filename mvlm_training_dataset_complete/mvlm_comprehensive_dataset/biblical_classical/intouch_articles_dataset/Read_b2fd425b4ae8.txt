Giving Jesus First Place
When the Lord is our priority, we can have His joy and strength while facing whatever life brings.
When Christ has first place in our life, we will experience many blessings. These include . . .
A Quiet Spirit. As we turn our attention to the Lord and meditate on His Word, He “leads [us] beside quiet waters,” where we find rest for our soul (Psalm 23:2). A quieted heart and mind make us better able to discern what God is saying to us.
A Stronger Faith. Studying Scripture will enlarge our view of God and give us insight and direction. Our faith will grow as we follow His guidance and watch how He works on our behalf.
A Purified Heart. Like a mirror, the Bible reflects back to us who we truly are and reveals where we need to change. When we confess our sin, God promises to cleanse us from all unrighteousness (1 John 1:9).
A Prepared Mind. God wants to prepare us for the future—both the joyous times and the hard ones. Through the Holy Spirit’s ministry, we will be equipped for whatever life brings (2 Peter 1:3).
Paul’s life demonstrates what it means to give Jesus first place. Because he made Christ the Lord of his life (Galatians 2:20), the apostle knew joy amid trials and received the strength to face turmoil and difficulty. These blessings will also be ours when we give highest priority to our relationship with Jesus.
