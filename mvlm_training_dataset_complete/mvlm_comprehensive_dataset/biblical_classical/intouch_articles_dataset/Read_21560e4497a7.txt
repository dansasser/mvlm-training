Things That Cannot Be Shaken
Jesus is our Rock—when we choose to trust Him, we are eternally secure.
On the news, there are often interviews with people who’ve suffered an unimaginable tragedy. One day we’re shown tornado survivors whose homes were torn apart by powerful winds. Another day we may see unanticipated floods washing a neighborhood away. The expressions on the faces of those who have experienced devastation can be haunting.
Losses like these always draw our attention toward the fragility of those things we hold most dear—such as our homes, families, and careers. But in a world that often seems to be spinning out of control, believers in Jesus have the privilege of sharing the best news imaginable: We have something that’s stable, something completely secure. There is a rock on which we are able to stand, and it cannot be shaken.
That unshakeable foundation, of course, is Almighty God. We can trust that Scripture is His unchanging, relevant truth for all time (Matthew 24:35). We can depend on a secure eternal relationship with the Lord. And we can be sure that an everlasting heavenly home awaits all those who place their faith in Jesus Christ (Revelation 21:2-4). We can have stability, even in this unstable world.
Among the people you know, who needs this life-saving good news? Don’t wait—share it today.
