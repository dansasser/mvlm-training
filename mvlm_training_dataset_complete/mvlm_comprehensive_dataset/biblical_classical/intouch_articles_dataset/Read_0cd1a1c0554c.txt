Are you pursuing what matters? To find abundance, seek God first.
The poet William Wordsworth wrote, “The world is too much with us; late and soon, / Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers.” It’s a profound statement. After all, who hasn’t spent a time pursuing wealth or pleasure, only to discover that they’re worth far less than what we gave up in achieving them?
That’s why Jesus told the parable in today’s passage. The story is about a rich man who made plans to build larger barns but lost sight of what truly mattered. Jesus understands that things like food, shelter, and clothing are important. However, He wants us first to seek something greater—the kingdom of God (v. 31).
We don’t have to do without when we choose to pursue the Lord. Far from it! Promises of abundance fill God’s Word from Genesis to Revelation. And Scripture teaches that if we give freely of our blessings instead of clinging to them, we’ll gain far more. Jesus assured us that this type of generosity would result in “a good measure” being poured into our lap, “pressed down, shaken together, and running over” (Luke 6:38).
Spend some time in prayer today and ask the Lord to show you the better things He wants you to pursue (Matthew 6:19-21).
