Can You Trust Your Conscience?
A conscience isn't designed to be our guide; it’s a tool the Holy Spirit uses to help us become like Christ.
“Let your conscience be your guide.” This folk wisdom seems to make sense because our conscience is designed to help us discern right from wrong. But can we always trust it to steer us correctly?
For a conscience to be trustworthy, it must be honed and strengthened with scriptural teaching. Believers build themselves up by applying God’s truth to their life. They are committed to thinking and acting in ways that honor and please the Lord. Then, when sinful thoughts or choices come up, our conscience will deliver a warning, alerting us to danger (Romans 2:15).
Those with a reliable conscience will have a strong desire to obey God. Instead of settling for what feels right or looks good, they seek the Lord’s will. In other words, they do not rely solely on their conscience but incorporate all of the Holy Spirit’s tools—including Scripture and prayer—into their daily activities. Moreover, when challenged by temptation, they are quick to draw back and reject unwise choices.
A conscience isn’t designed to be our guide; it is a tool of the Guide. The Spirit of God not only convicts us of sin but also brings to mind scriptural principles and leads us. He uses a variety of tools to conform us to the likeness of Christ.
