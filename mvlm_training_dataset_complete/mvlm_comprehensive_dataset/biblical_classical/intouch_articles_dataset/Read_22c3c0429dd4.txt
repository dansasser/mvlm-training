An Imperishable Inheritance
Believers have a glorious inheritance reserved and protected for us in heaven.
We all want to feel safe and secure. But whenever we base our sense of security on the things of this world, we can expect to be disappointed. This is especially true when it comes to our finances. That’s why remembering our eternal future is so important.
Isn’t it wonderful to know that believers have an inheritance that cannot be stolen? It was given to us when we placed our hope in Jesus Christ and won’t ever be taken away because it’s reserved and protected for us in heaven. Someday, when we see Jesus face-to-face, we will receive and then forever enjoy the fullness of our inheritance.
But did you know that every day we live on this earth, we have an opportunity to build up that inheritance by investing in the things God values? That’s what Jesus was talking about when He said, “Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven” (Matthew 6:20). Whenever we live righteously and obey God, we’re adding to the treasure that awaits us.
Are you more concerned with investments in this life than with everlasting riches? It is very easy to let daily demands and responsibilities overshadow the importance of building eternal prosperity. Take time each day to refocus your mind and heart. Then start storing up wealth of lasting value.
