Defeating Discouragement
In impossible situations, God can move in unimaginable ways.
Discouragement can rob us of peace, joy, and contentment. But here’s great news if you feel disheartened: You aren’t stuck!
Let’s look at the life of Nehemiah. He had every reason to feel defeated, because his people were in trouble. After receiving news that the wall around the holy city of Jerusalem had been destroyed, this man of God acknowledged profound disappointment and grieved. Yet, even though pain flooded his soul, he didn’t allow himself to stay in that low place. Instead, he cried out to the Lord.
Since the king’s reaction was unpredictable and potentially harsh, Nehemiah prayed for success and a compassionate response. The Lord answered with amazing power, prompting the king to notice his servant’s sad countenance and to ask what he could do to help. This miracle led to a rebuilt wall and the redemption of God’s people.
The Lord can take any impossible situation and move in ways mightier than you can imagine (Ephesians 3:20). Do you live in eager expectation of what God will do, or have you chosen to linger in despair? Like Nehemiah, turn your disappointment into a petition for the Lord’s help. He can restore your hope and prevent negative emotions from gaining a foothold in your spirit.
