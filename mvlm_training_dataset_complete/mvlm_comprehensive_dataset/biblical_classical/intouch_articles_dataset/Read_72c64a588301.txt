To receive from God what you truly need, start by taking time to know and enjoy Him.
God loves us and wants to give us good things. But that doesn’t mean He will give us whatever we want whenever we want it. It’s wise to examine the desires that preoccupy us, because they reveal much about the true state of our relationship with Christ.
For example, take a moment to think about your aspirations:
Do you want to be in control? If you have pursued influence and authority, consider whether you’ve lost sight of the value of humility and righteousness before God.
Do you dream about wealth and fame? Perhaps you feel there’s something missing, some gap you’re trying to fill. However, remember that God alone can meet the deepest needs of the human heart.
The psalmist writes, “Delight yourself in the Lord; and He will give you the desires of your heart” (Psalm 37:4). There is nothing wrong with wanting certain things; our longings can motivate us to achieve goals. But rather than blindly asking only for what you wish, pray that God would help you align your needs to His will.
Some Christians are afraid to ask God for what they want—even good things. Maybe they’re afraid He won’t listen. But the Lord tells us to approach His throne with boldness and confidence (Hebrews 4:16).
