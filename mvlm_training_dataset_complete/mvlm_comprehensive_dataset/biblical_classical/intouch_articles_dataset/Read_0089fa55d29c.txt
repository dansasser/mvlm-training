Our Savior came to illuminate our lives and enable us to shine for Him in a dark world.
In the Bible, God’s first spoken words are “Let there be light” (Genesis 1:3). O Oriens, the next antiphon from “O Come, O Come Emmanuel,” is translated “O Dayspring.” Originally meaning the dawn of a new day, the term refers to the illuminating presence that God’s Word brought to the dark and formless world.
The same language describes the new creation that the Lord brings to us (2 Corinthians 5:7). John says that in Jesus—the eternal Word—is life, which is the “Light of mankind [that] shines in the darkness” (John 1:4-5). The other Gospel writers don’t miss the connection either. When Jesus moves to Capernaum after John the Baptist’s arrest, Matthew recalls Isaiah’s prophecy about the light coming to a dark place. People “sitting in darkness … sitting in the land and shadow of death” were visited by that light (Matthew 4:16).
Though parts of the world remain in shadow, we know that the Light has come—and He shines brighter than any sun. Today, ask God to illuminate every corner of your life “to give the Light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ” (2 Corinthians 4:6). And remember: As we “walk in the light” (1 John 1:7), we receive God’s forgiveness and are reconciled to Him. Then He makes us shine in a dark world.
