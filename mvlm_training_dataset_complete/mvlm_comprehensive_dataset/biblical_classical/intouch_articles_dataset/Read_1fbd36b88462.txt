Our heavenly Father wants us to be secure in our relationship with Him.
Newborn babies have the wonderful ability to fall asleep anywhere, untroubled by worry or fear. Our heavenly Father intends for believers to have the same sense of security—He wants us certain of our relationship with Him through Jesus and confident of its permanence.
But have you ever noticed how that sense of peacefulness changes by the time babies are toddlers? They often cry over small disturbances and are unwilling to leave a parent’s side. Their situation has not changed. They have the same safety and protection they enjoyed as infants, but they’ve lost their feeling of assurance.
Doesn’t this also describe us on occasion—when we don’t believe the promises of our heavenly Father? From the moment of salvation, we enjoy a permanent relationship with God, one that we will retain forever. But at times, we struggle to fully understand and embrace that gift.
Certainty about salvation doesn’t come from applying human logic. It is a matter of faith. Do we believe what God says or not? Whenever you feel yourself wavering, pray the words of 1 John 5:13: “These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life.”
