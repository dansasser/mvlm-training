The Struggle With Envy
Have you learned to trust God and be content with His plan for your life?
We all have expectations, desires, and hopes for life, but our plan isn’t always best. And what we see someone else experiencing may not be what our Father has in store for us. When you compare yourself with others, watch out! Envy is usually lurking close by.
Consider Saul. Appointed by the Lord to be Israel’s first king, he was given power and success. But hearing women praise David’s great victory over Goliath, Saul became jealous and suspicious (1 Sam. 18:6-9), to the point of obsession. And for several years he was driven by his fixation to do away with David.
This may seem like an extreme example. And yet, if we honestly examine ourselves, we will likely find that envy is hiding somewhere in our heart, too. Ask yourself, Is there anyone whose material, physical, or relational success causes me to feel displeasure or discomfort?
The fallacy of envy is that we can never view the entire picture of someone else’s life. Only God sees beneath the surface of what is visible to others. Our eyes should focus on our own walk with the Lord. He created each of us differently, and His plan for every individual’s life is unique.
