God has been transforming lives throughout history and will do the same today for anyone who trusts Him.
2 Corinthians 1:21-22
The first chapter of Matthew’s gospel records the lineage of Jesus. Starting with Isaac, the miracle child born to Abraham, there are 42 generations until the universe-altering event of the Savior’s birth. Among the names listed, there are schemers, prostitutes, murderers, kings, and idol worshippers. Many of these men and women had their lives transformed by God and, by His miraculous workings, were given a place of honor in the ancestry of Christ.
The same God who orchestrated it all is the one who promises us eternal life through His Son Jesus Christ. The Bible records God’s faithfulness in keeping promises made to us, His children. He has reassured us that we who are born again have a place in His family (Romans 8:15). And the Holy Spirit has been given to us as a pledge, ensuring we will receive our eternal inheritance (2 Corinthians 1:21-22).
We need only enter into a personal relationship with Christ. There are no additional specifications to meet, and God’s blessings belong to us the instant we become His children. Our Father has promised, and we can count on Him.
