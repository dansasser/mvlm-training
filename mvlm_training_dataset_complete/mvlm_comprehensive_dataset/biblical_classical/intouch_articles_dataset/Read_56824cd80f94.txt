Grace and New Beginnings
Because of the immeasurable grace of God, it’s never too late for a new life.
2 Corinthians 5:16-18
2 Corinthians 5:16-18
After a long winter, cherry blossoms emerge in splendor, signaling the arrival of spring and new life. Visitors travel great distances to experience the glorious spectacle in cities like Tokyo and Washington, D.C.
God’s grace, like the cherry blossom, brings beautiful new beginnings through faith in Jesus (Ephesians 2:8). The gift of salvation is a gentle reminder that our past doesn’t define our future. The Lord, in His infinite wisdom and love, invites us to release yesterday’s burdens and embrace the promise of tomorrow.
In this season of newness, God’s grace urges us to look ahead for what is to come—though He never changes, He’s always doing a new thing. The prophet Isaiah reminds us that just as the cherry blossom signals renewal, God is continually working to bring new vitality and purpose into our life. “Do not call to mind the former things, or consider things of the past,” he writes. “Behold, I am going to do something new, now it will spring up ... I will even make a roadway in the wilderness, rivers in the desert” (Isaiah 43:18-19).
Is your heart open to the transformative work of God? He can bring renewal and hope to your life, creating paths in desolate places where you may have felt lost or abandoned. God is a trustworthy guide. Follow Him.
