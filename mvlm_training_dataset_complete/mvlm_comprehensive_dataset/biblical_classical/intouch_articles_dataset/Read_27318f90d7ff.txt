A Revolutionary Announcement
Do you believe all things are possible with God?
Early accounts of the Lord’s resurrection were treated like idle tales told by desperate individuals. In a way, that’s understandable since most people struggle to believe the impossible. But Pentecost was a new day.
History was made as each person in the crowd heard the gospel in his or her own language (Acts 2:6-11). The assembled throng knew of the Lord and His miracles. Some of those present may have been skeptics who’d joined in shouting, “Crucify Him!” (Matthew 27:22). Yet Peter boldly stated, “God raised [Jesus] from the dead” (Acts 2:24). Here was one of Jesus’ own followers claiming that the Christ couldn’t be held down by death’s power.
The revival sparked by the Holy Spirit that day resulted in 3,000 new believers who underwent baptism—a public declaration that Jesus died for their sins, rose again, and ascended into heaven. They changed communities as they lived out the gospel message of compassion and love. The revolution they started spread across the world and is still going on.
The day of Pentecost is a reminder of God’s sovereignty and grace—He ensures that all people open to the gospel will receive it in a language they can understand. Do you want to be transformed by Jesus’ saving grace? Take a moment to share your thoughts and feelings with Him now.
