The Godly Quality of Generosity
Are you experiencing the joy and wonder of giving sacrificially?
Generosity is an attitude of gladly sharing whatever we might have, regardless of our wealth. Scripture reveals that openhanded lavishness is an attribute of God (Deuteronomy 28:12). And as part of His transformative plan for believers, the Father desires that we develop a generous spirit.
A bighearted approach to our time and material goods starts by giving ourselves to God. When we accept that He owns everything, we will be able to hold our share more loosely. But the choice to nurture generosity is based on our trust. Instead of adding figures to see what little amount might safely be set aside for charity, Christians should give sacrificially by faith. Hebrews 13:16 (NIV) tells us, “Do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.” The Lord responds by supplying enough to cover the gift and our own need (Luke 6:38). Only through giving do we learn that we can never outgive God.
Some believers choose selfishness and rebellion, but God promised a form of poverty—whether financial, emotional, or spiritual—to those who do. Instead, let’s choose to cultivate a generous spirit for the Lord.
