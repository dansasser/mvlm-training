Defend Against Temptation
Temptation comes to all; the wise prepare for it.
When we struggle with temptation, understanding how it works can be helpful. Every sin originates as a thought (James 1:14-15). If we hold on to the thought, it becomes a fantasy—the chance to imagine what pursuing that notion would be like, without actually doing so. Fantasies can easily become entangled with our emotions. This creates a desire, which brings us to the point where a choice must be made. And we must either consent to the sin or refuse. This process is quite dangerous, as the progression from thought to choice can be almost instantaneous.
Wise believers determine ahead of time to resist temptation. They build the defense before the offense happens. There are two cornerstones to a good defense: the recognition that God’s in control and the commitment to obey Him (1 Corinthians 10:13; James 4:7).
We can further fortify our defense when temptation actually comes. Satan has a way of spotlighting the pleasure of sin until it’s all we see. But with prayerful effort, we can retrain our focus to take in the bigger picture: Is this choice a violation of God’s Word? What are the consequences?
No one can resist temptation perfectly—we’ll all continue to struggle with sin. But the more we meditate on Scripture and communicate with God, the stronger our defense will be.
