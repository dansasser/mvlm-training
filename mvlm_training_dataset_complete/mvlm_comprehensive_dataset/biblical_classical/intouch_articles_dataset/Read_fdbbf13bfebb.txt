A Right View of Repentance
Jesus is ready to receive you right now—just as you are.
Preaching the truth about Jesus in Acts 2, Peter left thousands of listeners asking the same question: “What are we to do?”
The apostle’s response is simple: “Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins” (v. 38). As a result, 3,000 people were added to the new church that day (v. 41).
Does it seem strange that Peter said “repent” instead of “believe”? Scripture often uses these concepts interchangeably. Repentance and faith are two sides of the same coin: Both are essential for salvation, and each is dependent upon the other.
In terms of salvation, you cannot separate faith and repentance—both happen simultaneously. In order to be saved, you must place faith in Christ, and that faith decision requires a change of mind (repentance) about your way of life. Yet many people mistakenly believe they must dramatically change their way of living before they can follow Jesus. The truth is, repentance does not mean we must totally change our ways and “clean ourselves up” as a condition for receiving Christ as Lord.
Jesus is ready to receive you right now. Only as a child of God will you find the power—His power—to truly become the person you were created to be.
