When God Questions Us
In His kindness and mercy, God at times answers questions we didn't ask and reminds us who He is.
Job likely never imagined that his questions for God might be turned around on him in a litany of questions from God. Beginning with verse 4 of today’s passage, what the Lord asked revealed His power and sovereignty over creation and every area of human life. Though His answering from the whirlwind sounds intimidating, God’s revelation was meant to strengthen Job’s faith—as well as ours.
What can we learn about God’s character through His questions? Although they are impossible to answer, the Lord’s willingness to converse with His servant directly reveals deep love. It also indicates His longing for Job to understand that He’s been working behind the scenes all along—even trusting His follower to faithfully endure suffering at Satan’s hands.
By exploring God’s rhetorical questions, we will also be reoriented: We are the created, not the Creator—the servant rather than the Master (John 13:14-16). And no matter how things appear, God is working all things together for our good and His glory. Even if we don’t understand how He makes that happen, we can trust that the Lord is ready to hear everyone who calls upon His name.
