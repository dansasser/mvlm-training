Our Incomparable Companion
Because the Holy Spirit lives inside us, we are never truly alone.
Loneliness will creep into most lives at some point. However, as believers, we are never truly alone because God has given us an unfailing companion—the Holy Spirit.
None of us can truthfully promise always to be available; the realities of time, distance, and even death can separate people. Thankfully, by sending the Holy Spirit to live inside of us, Jesus keeps His promise to never leave or forsake us (Hebrews 13:5).
Human beings were never meant to live alone. God designed us to be complete only when we are indwelt by His Spirit, which occurs upon our salvation. We can, however, choose to ignore the Holy Spirit. For example, some people stubbornly attempt to live the Christian life in their own strength or skip Bible reading when they find meditating on the Word inconvenient. That kind of life is marked by discontent: Peace will be fleeting, and loneliness will feel like the heart’s permanent resident.
The Holy Spirit is our parakletos, or companion who “walks beside.” If we hold Him at arm’s length, we distance ourselves from the Father as well. But if we ask the Spirit to guide our steps and open our mind to God’s plans, He will support and encourage us in ways we never imagined.
