When God calls you to stand for Him, go forward with courage—the battle is the Lord's.
David’s short battle with Goliath was more than a fight between Israel and the Philistines. It was a defense of Jehovah’s name against those who doubted Him. As David pointed out, the only way a boy with a sling could defeat a giant warrior like Goliath was by the Lord’s hand. And that’s exactly what happened.
In facing Goliath, David showed real courage and faith. But we see that what drove him to face the giant was righteous indignation: “For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he has dared to defy the armies of the living God?” (1 Sam. 17:26). David believed that someone had to wipe away the reproach caused by Goliath’s insults. Since no one else would step forward, he volunteered to defend Yahweh’s name.
At one point or another, we also will find ourselves in a situation that challenges us to stand up for the Lord. At such a time, will we listen to our fears and remain silent? Or will we represent God’s name in the way for which He’s called and equipped us? Our “smooth stones” (v. 40) are the truths from God’s Word. Whatever the outcome appears to be, the battle is the Lord’s, and He gives victory to the faithful.
