Building a Life Message
Our lives should reflect the light of Christ and draw others to Him.
What statement is your life making?  Jesus said that to the watching world, believers should be like salt and light. If we add salt to soup, the improved taste is obvious, and when we bring light into a room, darkness flees. Our character, conduct, and conversation should make a statement about the importance of God, the necessity of Jesus, and the power of the Holy Spirit.
To lead a life of significance that brings glory to the Lord, believers must begin by reading and studying the Scriptures. As we meditate on God’s Word, He reveals Himself and we gradually absorb His principles, which begin to show in our daily living.
One good way to learn Scripture’s lessons is by researching the lives of great saints like Abraham, Moses, Daniel, Ruth, David, Esther, Mary, and Paul. Their stories have much to teach us about the way they coped, what they discovered from mistakes, and how they interacted with the Lord.
From these biblical accounts as well as other passages, we learn that our heavenly Father has a goal for our life. He desires to conform us to the image of His Son. Recognizing this, we can cooperate and become beacons guiding others to Christ, as the apostle Paul did: “Be imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ” (1 Corinthians 11:1).
