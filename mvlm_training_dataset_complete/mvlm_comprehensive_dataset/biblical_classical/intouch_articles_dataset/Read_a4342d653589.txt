The Words of Our Mouth
Are your words strengthening those around you or giving them burdens to carry?
Our words help us do many good things: We can use them to talk to our heavenly Father. We can speak the truth of Scripture and sing praises to Jesus Christ. We can love, encourage, advise, and teach those around us. The list goes on and on.
However, our voices also have the power to do great harm. When a problem like this occurs, it’s often been triggered by something small—perhaps a critique made in anger or a jab caused by envy. Harsh words may feel good, even justified at times. But they never bring about what God desires because, in the end, they aren’t life-giving. They’re not what we, as Christ-followers, are meant to offer (Matthew 22:36-40).
Jesus teaches us that “the good person out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth what is good … for his mouth speaks from that which fills his heart” (Luke 6:45). So, while negative feelings and speech may arise in us from time to time, it is important to pause and take note of them. Let’s analyze what’s really causing those harsh words and pray that the Lord will continue to soften our heart and increase our capacity for kindness.
