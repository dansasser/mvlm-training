God’s Purpose in Difficult Times
Though we would rather skip life's hardships, God has a good reason for allowing them.
If we could design an ideal life, most of us would skip times of hardship. But Scripture teaches us that God has a purpose in the storms of life.
Cleansing. When problems press in on us, ungodly habits and attitudes tend to surface. Impatience, a quick temper, or reliance on something or someone other than the Lord may become apparent. The Holy Spirit will use tough times to smooth away our rough edges and produce the fruit of the Spirit in us. (See Galatians 5:22-23.)
Companionship. When life is good, we may spend less time with the Lord and start taking our relationship with Him for granted. Hard times bring us to our knees in prayer and drive us to seek opportunities for His companionship.
Our heavenly Father’s desire is for us to develop Christlike character. He wants us to grow closer to Him, experience the richness of His love, and wholeheartedly show Him devotion.
Life brings trouble to us from many sources. But the common thread in all trials is the Lord’s desire and ability to use them for our good and His glory. As a result, we’ll be able to let go of ungodly traits and experience sweet communion as we walk in intimacy with our Father.
