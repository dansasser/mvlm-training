How Comforters Are Created
God never wastes anything—He often calls us to use our pain to minister to others.
Job asked a challenging question during his time of suffering: “Shall we actually accept good from God but not accept adversity?” (Job 2:10). Even hardship has a place in the Lord’s plan.
We can find great solace in Paul’s words about our loving God, who “comforts us in all our affliction so that we will be able to comfort those who are in any affliction” (2 Cor. 1:4). Think about the kind of people you seek out when you feel hurt. You want someone who has felt your pain, right? A person who’s walked the path we find ourselves on can understand our suffering and provide wise counsel. According to the apostle, passing through a “valley experience” prepares us to be a blessing and encouragement to those who must go through something similar later. What’s required is that we accept the adversity He has placed in our way and choose to learn from the situation.
God is the Lord of our life, and He has the right to use us as comforters and encouragers to those in our sphere of influence. As His servants, we must be willing to receive whatever training is necessary to complete His will, including times when it hurts. Even in suffering, we can trust that He loves us and has a plan and purpose for our life.
