God’s Pathway of Goodness
Are you on the path God has chosen for you, or have you drifted off course?
To experience the fullness of God’s kindness, we must honor Him with our submission and obedience. He will never withhold His goodness from those who walk uprightly with Him (Psalm 84:11).
In love and wisdom, the Father has specifically designed a plan for each of His children (Jeremiah 29:11). Since no two people are alike, each path will look different; for that reason, comparing God’s ways in your life with how He works in others’ lives can lead to discouragement and misjudgment. We have neither the wisdom nor the eternal perspective to understand why some people face hardship, but we can know He’s at work through it.
Every step on God’s pathway represents an ongoing choice to follow Him. By looking around instead of fixing our eyes on Jesus, we may start thinking that we’re missing out on some good experiences or possessions. If we leave the Lord’s course, we will forfeit some of His good blessings and discover, as Adam and Eve did, that any other way leads to loss.
Take time to ask yourself, Am I on the path the Lord has chosen for me, or have I taken a detour to follow another direction that looks good? Building our own course and ignoring the goodness and abundance of His pathway is never a good idea because God alone knows the way we should take.
