The Power of Patience
Will you trust the Lord to wisely give—or not give—in His perfect timing?
Picture yourself in a checkout line that hasn’t moved for 10 minutes. Many of us would feel frustrated; we want quick results.
Everyone struggles with some degree of impatience. We’re born with this trait—think about a hungry baby. The natural reaction is to fuss at the first hint of discomfort and to keep at it until the need is met. Patterns from our sin nature make this a continual battle, but one that is very much worth fighting.
In the Bible, the word patience can refer to both longsuffering and perseverance. It reveals itself when we are willing to wait without frustration while suffering or experiencing some strong desire. What’s more, being patient means accepting whatever God chooses to give (or not to give) and willingly receiving it on His timetable. In the meantime, we should pray and obey as we seek His direction. The danger of impatience is that we might miss the Lord’s perfect plan and blessing. But when we trust our Father’s will and timing, we will know inner peace.
Remember to carefully examine whether you are taking matters into your own hands or releasing the circumstance to almighty God. Follow Psalm 37:7, which says, “Rest in the Lord and wait patiently for Him.” And always remember to seek God’s way and His timing.
