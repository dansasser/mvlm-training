Are You Focusing on God or Obstacles?
God is able to overcome any problem we face.
Numbers 13:25-33; Numbers 14:1-10
God told the Israelites to go and possess the land of Canaan. The people needed a place to thrive as a nation, and He chose an exceptionally good land for them.
So at the Lord’s direction, Moses sent 12 men to survey and spy out the area. What a surprise when 10 of them returned with unfavorable, alarming stories. Most of them could see only the obstacles. However, Caleb and Joshua were positive they’d “surely overcome” (Num. 13:30)—that was because they were focused on God’s promises rather than obvious difficulties. Their confidence was based on the Lord’s words to Abraham: “To your descendants I will give this land” (Genesis 12:7).
The rest of the Israelites didn’t share the two men’s faith—tales of giants and fortified cities scared them. Ordinarily, those would’ve been obstacles worth fearing. But their omnipotent God had proven He could overcome anything: He’d parted the Red Sea to facilitate their escape and fed them in the desert.
Focusing on obstacles distorts our vision. Then problems loom so large we can’t see to take the next step in faith. But if God has called us to do something, the reality we need to see is this: He’s already planned a way around, over, or through any barriers that might lie on the path to fulfilling His purpose for our life.
