Is Anyone Beyond God’s Reach?
The miraculous power of God’s love will flow through us when we obey His command to forgive.
Three years after her release from the Ravensbrück concentration camp, Corrie ten Boom came face-to-face with a former Nazi guard. She was in Munich to give a speech, and just as she finished, the man walked toward her. He said, “I have become a Christian. I know that God has forgiven me … but I would like to hear it from your lips as well.” And, empowered by the love of Christ, she did just that.
The man had actively participated in the Holocaust, one of the worst atrocities in the history of mankind. Yet he wasn’t beyond the Lord’s reach. Called “out of darkness into His marvelous light” (1 Peter 2:9-10), this onetime enemy received the mercy offered only by almighty God.
The Holy Spirit is always working to bring men and women to saving faith. He uses believers’ lives and testimonies—like those of Corrie ten Boom and her former guard—to rescue others. “I am the Light of the world,” Jesus told His disciples. “The one who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life” (John 8:12). That promise is for you—and also for the world.
