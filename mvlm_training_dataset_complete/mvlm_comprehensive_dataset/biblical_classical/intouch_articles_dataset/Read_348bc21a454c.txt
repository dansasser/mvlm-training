A Prayer for Everyone
To pray according to the will of God, begin with His Word.
Sometimes we want to pray for another person but aren’t sure what to say. Let’s look at Paul’s prayer in Colossians 1:9-14. Every word fits perfectly with God’s will, so you can present these requests with confidence—both for yourself and for others:
To be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding. We need to follow God daily, and we also need discernment to distinguish His guiding voice.
To walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, pleasing Him in all ways. Our life should be patterned after the One we follow.
To bear fruit in every good work. Instead of being wrapped up in our own circumstances, we should have a productive kingdom mindset.
To increase in the knowledge of God. When we read His Word and apply its principles, our understanding of Him will deepen.
To be strengthened with His power so we remain steadfast. The Christian life can be lived only with the Holy Spirit’s power.
To joyously give thanks for all God has done for us. Believers should be characterized by joy and gratitude.
Imagine how effective your prayers will be when you shift the emphasis of your petitions to the Lord’s desires. He will transform you and the people for whom you intercede.
