Are you getting to know the one true God—or has your view of Him been based on an unreliable source?
If you ask a group what God is like, you’ll likely get different replies. Most of the time, the answers reveal more about the speakers than about God. In fact, the truth about God might surprise you.
As the Father reveals Himself in Scripture, one word that’s never used in referring to Him is “it.” God is a person; in every reference, He is given a name (Yahweh, Elohim, Lord) or referred to by masculine pronouns (He, Him). He has all of the attributes of personhood—intelligence to reason, emotions to feel, and the will to make decisions.
Scripture also shows God’s immutability. Neither the Lord’s nature nor His character ever changes—He is always Spirit, and His love remains constant. We can all expect that God’s principles will hold true and that He will act exactly as He has promised. Delight, anger, and other feelings are not new traits but part of His being, and His emotions are always an appropriate fit for each situation.
God is eternal—He has no beginning or end (Psalm 90:2) and is the same yesterday, today, and forever. No one created Him; He simply is. That’s hard for humans to understand, as His ways sometimes are (Romans 11:33). But we should be thankful our God is far greater than what we are able to grasp.
