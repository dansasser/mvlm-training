Taking the Yoke of Jesus
When we choose to trust God, the weight of our problems shifts onto His shoulders.
Giving our burden to the Lord in order to take His yoke may sound like a zero-sum game, where one heavy load is merely exchanged for another. But the yoke of Jesus Christ is not a new kind of weight. In fact, it is a symbol of the believer’s transformation: Submitting our burden to the Lord means submitting our very selves to Him as well.
We are often reluctant to give up authority over our own life. The illusion of having control of our circumstances gives us a false sense of security. But the truth is that until we allow the heavenly Father to manage our life, we will instead be managed by our problems, chasing after the quickest solution or the easiest escape from pain.
Through prayer, meditation, and daily Bible reading, we must learn how to walk in the same way our Lord and Savior did. As our steps begin to align with His, our new yoke shifts the weight of our problems onto His shoulders.
The most important concept we must learn is to trust God. Psalm 55:22 says, “He will never allow the righteous to be shaken,” which means He is faithful to carry the weight and show us how to care for those affected by our burden. Trusting the Lord lightens the load.
