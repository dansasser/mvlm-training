Distractions offer only temporary relief from pain; in contrast, our heavenly Father promises healing.
In times of distress, we can fall into the habit of turning to God as a last resort. Food, relationships, careers, technology, and entertainment—these and other forms of escapism allure us with the false promise of relief. But whether we indulge in sweets, mindless scrolling on social media, or pointless busyness, we’ll always find ourselves empty and drained afterward. Worse still, the problem that sent us running is still there when we get back.
Reaching for God instead of our distractions requires the pain of being present in our distress—fully aware of our deep need, seeking a heavenly solution instead of the pleasures and diversions of this world. In our reading today, God reminds the children of Israel that even in the messy, painful space between promise and fulfillment, He never begins something that He doesn’t complete. In Israel’s struggle to become a nation after years of suffering and exile, God never left them. Instead, Israel experienced His deliverance in abundant and diverse ways.
Since we are children of God, Israel’s promised deliverance is extended to us—it’s an invitation to turn to Him with full confidence that we will be comforted. We are assured that “He who began a good work among [us] will complete it” and see us through to the end (Philippians 1:6).
