God’s power frees us from sin and enables us to follow Him.
Can you remember a time when you were lost? That may be hard to imagine in this age of the GPS, but not long ago we relied on physical maps, landmarks, and waypoints to discern the correct path.
The hymn “O Come, O Come, Emmanuel” calls Adonai the “Lord of might” and reminds us how God showed the Israelites His way. They began their journey when a burning bush beckoned Moses onto a different path, and he in turn brought them out of captivity in Egypt. God then led the people through the wilderness by pillars of cloud and fire. At Mount Sinai, He gave the Ten Commandments—His law that would provide a “map” showing them how to walk with Him.
Israel ultimately rejected that law and made their own way. Thankfully, God’s redemptive plan included an even greater deliverance. While presenting both Moses and Jesus as lawgivers who rescued the people, Scripture clearly shows Jesus as the new and better Moses. The crucial difference is that the Old Testament law exposed and condemned sin, whereas “the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus” offers forgiveness and life (Romans 8:2).
As we sing “Come, great Lord of might,” we honor Jesus as our deliverer and Lord. We pray, too, for courage to follow Him and His way.
