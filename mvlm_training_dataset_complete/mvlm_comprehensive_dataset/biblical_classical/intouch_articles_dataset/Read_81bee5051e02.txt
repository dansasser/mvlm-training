Communion With Our Lord
Don't let the busyness of daily living rob you of the joy and fulfillment that come from time with God.
Genesis 1:26-27 teaches that God created us in His image. As a result of Adam’s transgression, however, sin entered the world and separated us from God. Knowing our dilemma—that we’re enslaved by our “flesh” and cannot make ourselves righteous—Jesus came to restore us and return us to a right relationship with the Father. Because Christ is perfectly holy, innocent, and undefiled (Hebrews 7:26), He alone qualified to carry our sins to the cross. When we receive Jesus’ finished work on our behalf, we are acknowledging His lordship over our life. Then we’re adopted into God’s family (Ephesians 1:4-5).
Take a moment to reflect on Christ’s sacrifice. Jesus, the One without sin, took on mankind’s sins—past, present, and future—to save us from eternal separation from the Father. He willingly gave His life so we might be reconciled to God and live with Him forever. As we ponder this amazing demonstration of grace and love, our response should be a strong desire to spend time with Him.
Child of God, you were designed to have sweet communion with your heavenly Father. Jesus died so that you and I might become part of His family. How strong is your need for fellowship with Him? Does it override the clamor of the week’s events or get lost in the demands of daily living?
