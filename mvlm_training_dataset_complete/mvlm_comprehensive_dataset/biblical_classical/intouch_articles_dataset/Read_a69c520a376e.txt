Through prayer, we can participate in God's work all over the world.
Those who ask will receive answers. Those who seek will find. Those who knock will have the door opened. The acrostic “A-S-K” will help us remember to “ask, seek, and knock.”
Our heavenly Father wants us to pray, not only because it honors Him but also because communicating helps us grow closer to Him. What’s more, prayer connects us to His work in the world. You can pray for anyone anywhere and have confidence that the God of the entire universe will hear you and answer.
For this reason, prayer is one of the best ways to get involved in kingdom work. What a wonderful privilege it is to be able to participate in God’s mission by asking Him to help His children and impact His creation.
Another reason the Lord instructs us to pray is to build our faith in Him. Even sinful men give gifts to their children. How much more does our God enjoy giving good gifts to those who ask Him (Matt. 7:11)! The Lord also loves to answer our prayers and see us grow bolder in our walk and witness.
God’s Word tells us that He is faithful because “He cannot deny Himself” (2 Timothy 2:13). Be certain to set aside time every day to speak with and listen to Him. Then you will learn this truth firsthand.
