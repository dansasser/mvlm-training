God’s Ways: Ordinary or Miraculous?
The Lord is always working for our good, but not always in ways we understand.
In Isaiah 55, God declares, “My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways” (Isaiah 55:8). In fact, that’s one of the biggest frustrations of the Christian life—a lack of understanding about God’s ways. There are times when we could really use a miracle, and He doesn’t come through for us, which can lead to confusion, disappointment, and anger. Why did God let me down?
God works in both supernatural and ordinary ways, and He determines the method. For example, in today’s passage, Elijah ate food miraculously delivered by ravens, but his water supply from a brook was completely natural. When it dried up, the Lord could have made more water spring from the ground, but He didn’t.
Sometimes God uses ordinary means to move us in a new direction. The curtailment of his water supply opened the door for Elijah’s next assignment. When the Lord withholds miraculous intervention and lets your brook dry up, then He has something else planned for you.
The work of God in the commonplace aspects of life is just as miraculous as His supernatural intervention. Look for His “fingerprint” in the day’s mundane activities. He is there, opening and closing doors, drying up one opportunity but initiating another.
