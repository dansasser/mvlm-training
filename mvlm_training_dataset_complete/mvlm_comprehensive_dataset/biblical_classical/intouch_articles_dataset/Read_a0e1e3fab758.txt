Talking with our heavenly Father is how we understand His heart and participate in His work on earth.
Have you ever wondered, If God is in control, why does He expect us to pray? The Lord wants to involve us in the work He is doing in the world, and prayer brings us into cooperation with what He plans to accomplish.
In John 17:11, Jesus asked God to protect the disciples by the power of His name. Did He think they might lose their salvation or permanently drift from their commitment? Absolutely not. Jesus was God in human flesh. He knew exactly what was going to happen—that those men would fulfill their mission and spread the gospel. Jesus was taking part in God’s plan for His followers by interceding for them (Romans 8:34).
The Lord certainly can build His kingdom without us. But when the God of love and His beloved share an interest, the relationship develops depth and intimacy. Praying and working alongside our Lord grows our faith and strengthens our trust in His power.
Talking with almighty God is a privilege. He loves you and invites you into relationship with Him. Prayer is how that connection gets nurtured. Our Father calls us to communicate with Him so He can draw us close to His heart and involve us in building the kingdom.
