God is sovereign; therefore, every hardship that reaches you has been allowed for a good and loving purpose.
Yesterday, we looked at Psalm 46:10, which instructs us to “cease striving” during the difficult times in our life. So just how is a believer to “be still” (KJV)?
First, we must understand that God is allowing our difficulties. If we believe that He is in control, then we must also believe that He has permitted these events to occur. Second, there is a purpose behind our trials, even when life seems confusing and hopeless. The Lord won’t allow hardships to come our way without good reason. Third, since there is a purpose for our hardships, they have the potential to be seen as positive in retrospect. This doesn’t mean everything will always work out perfectly, according to our own standards, hopes, and plans. But it does mean that if we respond correctly, we may look back on the experience as a catalyst for growth in our spiritual walk.
In Romans 8:28, Paul says, “And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.” You may have heard this familiar verse many times. But in order to endure the storms of life, you must understand its truth. The Lord hasn’t disappeared, and He isn’t ignoring you. He has a purpose in everything—even the most challenging of circumstances.
