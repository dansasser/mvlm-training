The Best Friend You Will Ever Have
Our Savior is forever faithful and will meet our every need.
Many of us are familiar with the hymn “What a Friend We Have in Jesus.” We know that our Savior is a great friend (John 15:15), but let’s consider some specific aspects of His relationship with us. He is ...
Committed to us. This commitment is for more than a lifetime—it’s eternal. And though life is bound to hold some disappointments, the Lord Himself will never let us down.
Open and transparent at all times. Jesus will continually show us more about Himself as we desire to learn.
Sensitive to our wants as well as our needs. He knows how to meet our deepest longings and lovingly invites us—over and over—to connect with Him.
An inspiring, comforting listener who’s never quick to criticize. He doesn’t interrupt, and His eyes are so lovingly fixed on us that His heart hears exactly what we are saying.
What kind of friend is Jesus? John 15:13 answers that question: “Greater love has no one than this, that a person will lay down his life for his friends.” Because He gave Himself for all people, we as His followers can certainly offer our friendship to someone else. Who in your circle of influence needs the sacrifice of your time or care?
