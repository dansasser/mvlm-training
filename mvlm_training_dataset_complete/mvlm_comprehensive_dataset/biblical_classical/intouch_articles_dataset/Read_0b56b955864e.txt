Will God Really Dwell on Earth?
The One who created all of heaven and earth chooses to be where we are—so we can know Him better.
The dream was a long time coming. But years after Solomon began its construction, God’s temple was finished. This magnificent structure was more than a building. It was the centerpiece of Israel’s identity—the place where the people would meet with God. There, He could live among them in a tangible way, in a place built to His specifications and befitting His glory.
In today’s passage, we can hear hope and longing in Solomon’s prayer of dedication: God, will You keep Your promises to our ancestors, to us, and to our children? The highest heavens can’t contain You—and yet, is it possible You will dwell here among us?
In some ways, this is our age-old question. In the garden of Eden, Adam and Eve communed with God. In the wilderness, as the liberated slaves journeyed to the Promised Land, they erected a tabernacle, a dwelling place for God among their own tents. In Jesus, we believe God came in the flesh to live—to “tabernacle”—with us. And in Revelation, God makes the incredible pronouncement that His dwelling will be with mankind forever (Revelation 21:3).
This hope may seem unbelievable, but God’s Word is true and unshakeable—a cause for joy. For now “we know in part,” but a perfect day will come when we will be united with our Lord and “know fully,” as we have been “fully known” (1 Corinthians 13:9; 1 Corinthians 13:12).
