The Price of Prayerlessness
God invites you to bring your burdens to Him every day.
God wants us to talk with Him, and Matthew 7:7-8 is an invitation to speak with Him about anything. Jesus said if we have a need, we’re to ask; if we seek answers, we’ll find them; if we want opportunities to open up, He will respond when we knock. Even so, many of us don’t spend as much time in prayer as we should.
Forsaking prayer can be costly. If we don’t spend time with the Lord, we might find ourselves on a slippery slope, sliding through weariness, discouragement, and doubt. Today let’s look at the first of these. Tomorrow we can examine the other two.
Certain situations take an emotional, physical, and/or spiritual toll—we call these burdens. They can wear us out if we attempt to endure them alone. But God doesn’t intend for that weight to fall on our shoulders. In fact, the Bible tells us to cast those loads on the Lord, who sustains us and “daily bears our burden” (Psalm 55:22; Psalm 68:19).
Hauling all our worries and cares around is exhausting because we are not built for such loads. In God’s design, His strength fills the believer to capacity. Picture Jesus’ shoulders just above your own—with Him bearing your problems. The burden may not disappear, but it feels blessedly lighter when you hand it over to the Lord.
