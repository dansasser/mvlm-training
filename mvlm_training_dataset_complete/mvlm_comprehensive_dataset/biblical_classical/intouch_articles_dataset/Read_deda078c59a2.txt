Faith is a gift from God that opens the door to salvation and enables us to enter into His Presence.
We often hear the word faith. However, when such a word is used frequently, it can become so familiar that we grow immune to its great depth of meaning. So today, let’s consider what faith actually entails.
Everyone has faith. For example, it takes a measure of confidence in a kitchen chair to sit down without first testing its strength. Yet believing furniture will hold our weight is quite different from entrusting our life to Almighty God.
Exactly what, then, is the biblical definition of faith? In Hebrews 11:1, we read that it is “the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.” And we know that it is impossible to please the Lord without faith (Hebrews 11:6). In fact, there is nothing we can do that will earn salvation; the only way to heaven is by having confidence in Jesus’ substitutionary sacrificial death on the cross, which paid the penalty we owed for our sin. What’s more, faith is nothing we can create within ourselves; Scripture is clear that it is a gift of God (Ephesians 2:8).
Have you accepted God’s gift of faith and embarked on the wonderful journey that He invites you to share with Him? If you’re not sure whether you’ve trusted your life to Him with full confidence, ask Him to guide you and reveal the truth.
