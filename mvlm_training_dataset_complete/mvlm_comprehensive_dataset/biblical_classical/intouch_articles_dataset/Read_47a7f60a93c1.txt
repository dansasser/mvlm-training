Leda Shelburne is putting her best foot forward to meet the needs of children in Albania.

Meeting a person’s basic needs is often an excellent way to share the gospel. That’s why, in the winter of 2018, Leda Shelburne began the Christmas Shoes Project. She oversees Media 7, Albania’s largest Christian media ministry. Serving in the country’s poorest regions, her team saw children in inadequate footwear—sometimes just slippers or socks in the bitter cold. She couldn’t stand by while little ones suffered.

Over time, the project has gained the attention and support of organizations and companies throughout Albania. Last year, more than 400 pairs of shoes were donated by mainstream businesses, from banks to grocery stores. As Shelburne—a crucial In Touch ministry partner to the Balkans—works with these organizations, she connects with their employees. Christians are a minority in Albania, but through the Christmas Shoes Project, she has a goal of sharing the hope of Christ with everyone involved, from the smallest child to the most powerful sponsor. “While we give away shoes, we pray for a new generation in Albania. We don’t just want to meet a need. We want to share Jesus—the best gift someone could ever receive.”
