What we believe about the Savior impacts life now—and forever.
No one has made a greater impact on this world than Jesus, yet many don’t understand who He is. Some believe His life began in a manger in Bethlehem, but in reality, He existed long before that (John 8:58). As a member of the Trinity, Jesus is the eternal Son of God, which means He has no beginning or end (John 1:1). His birth in Bethlehem was merely His physical entrance into the world He created.
Jesus was the long-awaited Messiah, who came to earth to carry out the mission given to Him by His Father. At one point, He asked His disciples, “Who do you yourselves say that I am?” (Matt. 16:15). This is the question each of us must answer. There is no middle ground when it comes to deciding who Jesus is, because He claimed that He was the only way to the Father (John 14:6). In today’s passage, when Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God,” Jesus told the apostle the Father had revealed this truth to him (Matthew 16:17). We, too, need God’s help to comprehend who Jesus is. The best way to understand Him is to examine His birth, life, and ministry as recorded in the Scriptures.
Once you’ve heard who He is and what He came to do, it’s time to respond. What will you do with Jesus?
