Have you accepted the gift of salvation Jesus died to give you? If not, you can say "yes" right now.
Yesterday, we looked at the knowledge that is essential for right belief. Now, let’s focus on the remaining elements of saving faith.
Knowledge of who Jesus is and what He did must be accompanied by conviction that the facts are true and apply to us:
We need to realize we all have broken God’s law.
We acknowledge none of our efforts can earn His favor.
We agree Jesus died for the world; He paid for all our sins.
We believe His death is sufficient payment for our wrongdoing, and nothing else is needed.
We must accept that He paid our penalty and endured the punishment in our place.
We accept by faith that we’ve been adopted into God’s family on the basis of Christ’s atoning death.
Once we are convinced that Jesus is our Savior, trust is demonstrated through action. As a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17), we are no longer who we were. Jesus has authority over our life, and He alone deserves to be our top priority. He knows what pleases the Father and has sent His Spirit to live in us and teach us.
Take time to examine yourself for evidence of knowledge, conviction, and trust. Then pray, thanking the Father for true saving faith—or asking Him for that gracious gift (Ephesians 2:8-9).
