In the School of Faith
Do you want a strong faith? Dedicate time to reading—and living—God's Word.
Jesus spent time developing His disciples’ faith because He knew it was essential for the tasks ahead of them. For over three years, they attended a school of faith, with Jesus as their instructor and His Word as their course material. Sometimes Christ used verbal instructions, but many of the lessons were taught by example: He healed the sick, cast out demons, fed thousands, and calmed the sea.
At times, the disciples’ understanding was slow or faltering, but Christ never gave up on them. He reproved them when they exhibited a lack of trust (Mark 4:40) but also praised signs of progress (Matthew 16:15-17). His objective was to firmly establish their faith so He could accomplish His work in and through them.
The Lord has the same goal for us—to increase our faith so we can do the work He’s planned for us (Ephesians 2:10). When our faith is great, He’ll entrust us with challenges and achieve amazing things through us. But small faith limits God’s activity in a believer’s life. He uses us only to the degree that we trust Him.
Faith is built by learning from Scripture what to believe, and then being tested in situations that stretch us to rely on God instead of our own understanding. Perhaps your next—or current—struggle is an opportunity to learn from the school of faith.
