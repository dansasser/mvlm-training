This Christmas season, remember and celebrate the joy and hope we have in Christ.
The Old Testament is filled with prophecies about the coming Messiah. A few of them probably left people wondering how one individual could fulfill such lofty promises. The birth of such a person would be “good news of great joy,” just as the angel proclaimed (Luke 2:10). The Messiah would be ...
A descendant of Abraham seated on David’s throne. Matthew and Luke trace Jesus’ genealogy (Matthew 1:1-17; Luke 3:23-38). God promised that all nations would be blessed through Abraham (Genesis 22:18), and Isaiah prophesied that Christ would reign forever on David’s throne (Isaiah 9:7). The gospel writers showed that Jesus could claim direct lineage from both of these men.
A man born in Bethlehem yet called out of Egypt. Though the Messiah’s predicted birthplace was Bethlehem (Micah 5:2), He was expected to come out of Egypt (Hosea 11:1). We know that a census brought Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem just in time for Jesus to be born. And Matthew’s gospel explains the rest of the mystery: To avoid Herod’s jealous rage, the family fled to Egypt, returning to Israel only after the king was dead (Matthew 2:13; Matthew 2:20-21).
God was specific in describing the Messiah so people would recognize the Anointed One and take joy in His coming. Today, as Advent begins, let’s remember this good news and rejoice.
