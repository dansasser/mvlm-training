A Name Full of Promise
God, who has always been and always will be, promises to be with us—always.
When God identified Himself to Moses, He said, “I AM WHO I AM.” This may seem like a strange name to us, but in essence, it’s saying He is completely self-existent from eternity past through the present and into eternity future. In other words, God’s presence is a sure thing.
However, His presence took different forms throughout Jewish history. For example, when God led the children of Israel through the wilderness, He went before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night (Exodus 13:21). After they built the tabernacle, He met with Moses there, speaking to him from above the mercy seat on the Ark of the Covenant (Exodus 25:22). While these were visible, physical manifestations, they were also symbolic of His everlasting presence.
Then, when Joshua finally led the Israelites into the Promised Land, God said, “I will be with you; I will not desert you nor abandon you” and “The Lord your God is with you wherever you go” (Joshua 1:5; Joshua 1:9). These promises are for us as well—offering reassurance that God will never leave His children.
So remember that our Father goes ahead of you and me to prepare the way, and He walks with us through every situation. Let us pray for awareness of His presence today.
