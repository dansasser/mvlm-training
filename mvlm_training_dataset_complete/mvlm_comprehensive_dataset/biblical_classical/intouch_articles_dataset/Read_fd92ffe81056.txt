Consider three areas that are prone to pride, and proactively confront it.
In today’s passage, Peter writes, “Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God” (v. 6). But how, exactly, do we do that? Here are several common areas of pride and some solutions for dealing with them.
Possessions. Start giving things away. Honoring God with your tithe is a good place to begin. The next step is to give to someone in need who can give nothing in return. But don’t broadcast what you’ve done; keep your generosity as secret as possible (Matthew 6:1-4).
Position. Acknowledge that whatever you have accomplished, God has done it for you (Isaiah 26:12). Our standing in this world matters only to the extent that we use it to glorify Him (James 1:9-11).
Privilege. Realize that many things you may take pride in come through privilege. None of us is truly “self-made”; no matter how hard you’ve worked, others have made sacrifices to allow you the opportunities and freedoms you enjoy. Remember, it is actually God’s grace that has blessed you.
What’s one thing you can do this week to grow in humility? When we are willing to confront our pride actively, God will replace it with a spirit that fits who we are in Christ.
