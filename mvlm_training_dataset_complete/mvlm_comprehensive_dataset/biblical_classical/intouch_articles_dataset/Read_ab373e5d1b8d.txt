Three Stages of Faith
Are you ready to grow in faith? All you have to do is ask.
We know we should trust the Lord, but it can seem overwhelming at times, can’t it? God doesn’t expect us to instantly have great faith. In fact, throughout the Gospels, Jesus met people where they were—from Thomas, for whom faith depended on seeing nail marks in the Savior’s hands, to the centurion, who believed his servant could be healed by a word from Christ (John 20:24-27; Matthew 8:5-13). And then there’s Peter, who trusted Jesus enough to get out of the boat but found the wind and waves too mind-boggling to continue (Matthew 14:28-31). Each time, Jesus displayed only grace and understanding.
Though it’s not a linear progression, there are three basic stages of faith. First, there’s little faith, which says, “I know He can but I’m not sure He will.” Next, as God proves Himself trustworthy, our faith grows and we begin to focus more on Him than on our circumstances. Finally, we should graduate to perfect faith, which says, “I believe what God says, so I’m going to act!”
Do you want to grow your faith? Spend time with God. Ask Him to help you trust more. When Peter became afraid of the waves, Jesus immediately reached out and caught him—and He’ll be there for you as well.
