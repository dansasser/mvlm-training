Persevere in Passing Down Your Faith
Our efforts may at times look like failures, but that doesn’t mean God has stopped working through us to achieve His purposes.
Is there someone with whom you’ve consistently but unsuccessfully tried to share Jesus? It can be disheartening, but God’s Word encourages us to not grow weary of doing good (2 Thessalonians 3:13). That’s the third way to pass along your faith: perseverance.
Yesterday we read about how to tell loved ones about Jesus through our actions, but doing something once or even a few times isn’t enough. There must be consistency. Does what you believe have merit in small situations as well as in major ones? Do you still trust God in those times when circumstances look impossible? How do you react when things don’t go your way? What do you do when life gets tough? Do you keep loving others no matter what?
Don’t be discouraged or feel guilty when you fall short. We all are human and will respond imperfectly at one point or another. What’s important is what we do next. Whenever you’re in a difficult moment, remember the wonderful words Paul wrote to the Galatians: “In due time we will reap, if we do not become weary” (Galatians 6:9).
