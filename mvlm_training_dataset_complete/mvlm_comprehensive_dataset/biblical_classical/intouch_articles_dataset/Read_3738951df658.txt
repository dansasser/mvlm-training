Raised from Fear to Faith
If we will remember the love and power of our Savior, no fear can paralyze us.
Though they knew that the tomb was empty—though they’d heard Mary Magdalene’s amazing story—the disciples were worried and wondering. Jesus had promised to rise again, true; but He had died, just as they’d seen many others die. They lost hope, perhaps assuming they, too, were as good as dead. Fear had gripped them and locked them away.
But Jesus had other plans. John noted that it was “the first day of the week” (20:19), and just as God’s Word was there at the creation of all things (John 1:1), Jesus the Word was suddenly present for a new creation. “Peace,” He said before showing them the wounds that won their salvation (20:19-20). Then, much like God breathing His Spirit into man at the beginning, Jesus breathed the life of the Spirit into His disciples, fulfilling the promise He would make to be with them always.
Jesus’ resurrection meant a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17), a new and abundant life in the Spirit, and a renewed purpose. The disciples were sent out to “make disciples of all the nations” and teach people to live as Jesus commanded (Matthew 28:19-20).
The same promise and purpose are ours. If we will remember His promise of presence, no fears can lock out the Savior, and no threat of death can withstand His resurrection power.
