The God Who Meets All Needs
Our heavenly Father is concerned about every aspect of our life.
God’s care for us isn’t limited to spiritual matters. He is interested in the details of our daily life too. We tend to divide life into categories, distinguishing between issues related to work, home, and faith. But our heavenly Father sees us as whole persons.
Scripture shows that God keeps bodies fed (Luke 12:29), minds wise (Proverbs 2:6-7), and hearts at ease (Philippians 4:7). And since believers are in union with Jesus through His indwelling Spirit, every aspect of a Christian’s existence has a spiritual connection. There is not a time in the day when the Christian’s life separates into “sacred” and “secular” components.
The Word of God stresses His commitment to believers’ whole selves: “His divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness” (2 Peter 1:3). We need never wonder if He can or wants to meet our needs. El-Shaddai, the all-sufficient One whose kindness never ceases (Lamentations 3:22), gives believers whatever is required to grow their faith—whether that is food, comfort, knowledge, or peace.
The loving heavenly Father sees His children as whole people rather than physical beings with a spiritual life on the side. We cheat ourselves when we think God is interested solely in our spiritual needs. He has many kinds of blessings to offer—all we have to do is ask.
