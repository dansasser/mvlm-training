Cease Striving and Know
Before you respond in a difficult moment, be still and remember you can trust God.
We have all experienced temptations, trials, and suffering at some point in our life. No one is immune to hard times, but believers are empowered through the Holy Spirit to endure periods of struggle. As Psalm 46:10 says, “Cease striving and know that I am God.”
How humbling it is to know that as God’s children, we have a direct line of communication to Him, even in the midst of trouble. We don’t have to respond with rage, depression, or sorrow. Nor do we have to fix everything in our own strength. Sure, we will still be tempted by the flesh. But as we “cease striving,” we’ll learn to trust in God more and more each day.
The truth is, hardship not only forms our character but also reveals it. One of the most common responses to difficult times is anger. In moments of frustration, we run the risk of making impulsive decisions that could impact the rest of our life. But instead of getting caught up in the emotion, we should wisely be still and trust in the One who controls every aspect of our life.
In this world, troubles won’t vanish (John 16:33). But when storms are brewing on the horizon, have confidence that the Lord will guide you through. Only in Him can you truly cease striving.
