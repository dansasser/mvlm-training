Choosing to align our thoughts with God's Word will move us toward the abundant life our Creator designed.
1 Corinthians 2:12-16
1 Corinthians 2:12-16
We all want to live happy, fulfilled lives, but what does that look like? The best life we could possibly live is the one our Creator has designed for us. He loves us and provides everything we need to become more like Him and achieve all He has planned. And the way we think is vitally important in this process.
Today’s passage teaches that believers have been given “the mind of Christ” (v. 16). This ability to align our thoughts with the Savior’s is a gift that we receive from God at salvation. However, the practice of it is our responsibility. If we are to experience the abundant life the Lord wants us to have, old thoughts that don’t agree with God’s Word must be replaced with His truth. As we learn from Him in this ongoing process, our lives will be completely changed.
Compare your thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs with biblical teachings. If they don’t match, reject those patterns of thinking and fill your mind with corresponding truths from Scripture instead. Since the Lord has empowered believers, let’s cultivate the mind of Christ within us.
