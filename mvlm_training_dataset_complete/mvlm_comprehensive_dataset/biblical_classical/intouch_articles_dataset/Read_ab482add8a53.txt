A Life-Changing Prayer
In God’s Word, we can learn a lot about how to intercede for our loved ones.
There are times when we may wonder whether our prayers are really accomplishing anything—when no matter how passionately we pray, the Lord seems unmoved and nothing changes. However, we need to persevere and trust Him to act with His perfect wisdom and timing. James 5:16 says, “A prayer of a righteous person, when it is brought about, can accomplish much.” Therefore, our goal should be to learn to pray effectively.
Colossians 1:9-12 is an example of just such a prayer. The apostle Paul is asking that the believers in Colossae be filled with the knowledge of God’s will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding. We, too, must learn what Scripture has revealed about the Lord’s desires for our life so we can obey His will in the following ways:
Live in a manner worthy of the Lord so we’ll please Him.
Bear fruit in every good work.
Increase in the knowledge of God.
Be strengthened with His glorious power to attain steadfastness of faith.
If you want to see your prayers become effective and life-changing, pray these verses for yourself and fellow believers. Then be patient and wait for God’s will to come to fruition.
