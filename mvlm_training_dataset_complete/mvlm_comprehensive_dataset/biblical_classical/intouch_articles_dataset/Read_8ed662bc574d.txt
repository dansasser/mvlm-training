Those who find their security in Christ can stand firm and be at peace when troubles come.
The Lord has ways of shaking the world when He is at work. He literally caused the ground to quake when Jesus died on the cross (Matthew 27:51), and Hebrews 12:26 describes a time to come when the earth will undergo a similar display of His power and presence.
Likewise, God often lets the foundations of our personal world be shaken—whether through financial difficulties, family crises, or difficult diagnoses. If we’ve built our life on human wisdom, pride, conditional love, or the like, things may look good for a while but will collapse when storms hit.
Adversity affects everyone, yet we can have peace in knowing that God always has a greater purpose when He allows it into our life. Hard times can shake believers out of apathy and self-focus, reminding us not to trust in ourselves or the temporary structures of this world. There is only one secure foundation: a genuine, deep relationship with Jesus Christ, which will carry us through anything. No matter what storms are raging all around us, we’ll have a solid footing if we stand on His love.
Though our trials are challenging, we as believers are blessed with the security of a firm foundation. We also have the responsibility and honor of helping others to become strong in God’s grace (2 Timothy 2:1). Be a living message of hope to those around you today.
