Faith lets us lose our fear and trust God for the impossible.
Faith isn’t a passive belief. It’s an active confidence that stirs within our soul—an unwavering trust in God’s promises and a firm conviction about His trustworthiness. When we’re surrounded by uncertainty, our faith guides us and illuminates the path.
Verse 1 of today’s passage says, “Now faith is the certainty of things hoped for, a proof of things not seen.” Those words can be viewed as an encouraging invitation to dwell in trust, which steadies the heart and anchors the soul. They’re also a reminder that our hope rests in a loving and sovereign God.
In times of trials and challenges, faith becomes our refuge, whispering, “Don’t be afraid, for God is with you.” It motivates us to step out in obedience, even if doing so seems impossible. And it empowers us to face adversity with courage, knowing that God is working all things together for our good.
The Lord calls us to walk by faith (2 Corinthians 5:7) and surrender our doubts and fears to Him. He wants us to believe His promises, even when circumstances seem bleak; trusting in Him lets us see beyond the visible to the eternal. Then we will find strength, peace, and the presence of our loving God guiding us every step of the way.
