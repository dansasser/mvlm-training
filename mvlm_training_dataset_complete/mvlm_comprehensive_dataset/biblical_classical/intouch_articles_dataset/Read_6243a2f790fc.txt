The Cup and the Covenant
Jesus instituted the Lord's Supper to help us remember all we have through Him.
Jesus’ last meal with His disciples took place during Passover. Giving them bread, He said, “This is My body” (Matt. 26:26). Next, offering wine, He told them, “This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many” (vv. 27-28). Believers today observe the Lord’s Supper as a symbol of ...
Cleansing. Starting with Adam and Eve, God required a sacrifice to cover transgressions (Genesis 3:21; Leviticus 17:11). But this was just a temporary solution. Jesus was God’s permanent answer to the problem: He took upon Himself all sin—past, present, and future—and died to pay the full penalty in our place.
Consecration. When people trust in Jesus Christ for salvation, they are set apart to the Lord. Their sins are forgiven, and they receive eternal life as well as the indwelling Holy Spirit. The bread and the cup are an opportunity to remember what God expects of His children and to renew a commitment to obey.
Communion. We are connected not only with the Lord who saved us but also with past and present believers. Among members of God’s family, we find comfort and support.
The Lord’s Supper is a good time to stop and recall what Jesus has given us. Let’s partake solemnly and gratefully.
