Our daily choices can ignite our passion for God—or extinguish it.
1 Thessalonians 5:16-24
1 Thessalonians 5:16-24
If you’ve ever been camping, you know a fire needs fuel to burn. Campers will use dry sticks and leaves to get the flames started, but when it is time to sleep, they will either starve the fire or put it out with water or dirt.
The Lord has lit a fire in every believer’s heart, and Paul warns against quenching it (1 Thess. 5:19). According to him, we must tend the flame of faith with care.
Nothing can completely extinguish the fire of salvation within believers—Jesus says, “No one will snatch them out of My hand” (John 10:28). However, it is possible for the flames to dim over time, especially when we repeatedly make choices that don’t line up with God’s Word. Sin tends to muffle the clarity of His voice in our life. It’s as if we throw cold water on our heart’s fire.
Thankfully, believers can simply fan their flame with spiritual “kindling.” Any time you choose to pray, read Scripture, confess sin, speak a kind word, or serve someone, you are stoking the fire God set in your heart. No spiritual discipline is practiced in vain.
What small step can you take today that would add dry leaves to your divine fire?
