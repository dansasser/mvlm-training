The Holy Spirit illuminates the Word of God for all who want to know truth.
Have you ever watched a baby eat? Hungry little ones clutch the bottle and smack their lips, thoroughly enjoying their warm milk. But there comes a time when that liquid nutrition isn’t enough to satisfy the baby’s appetite anymore. That’s when a whole world of culinary possibilities opens up.
Today’s passage compares new believers to babies, saying that they “long for the pure milk of the word” (v. 2). You wouldn’t feed a newborn steak and potatoes, would you? Well, baby Christians must sip scriptural truths that they understand. Then, like a growing child, they shoot up as they feast on Bible passages, gradually taking on more substantive principles and topics.
Believers aren’t left alone to make sense of the Scriptures any more than babies are expected to get meals for themselves. The Holy Spirit, who indwells God’s followers, illuminates the Word. Moreover, according to 1 Corinthians 12:28, God has provided preachers and teachers. These leaders provide instruction and clarification, motivating people to grow in their personal faith and to fulfill the church’s purpose of reaching the lost.
God’s Word is a feast for our heart, mind, and spirit. This is one banquet table where we will never be full.
