Keeping Your Eye on the Lord
Fix your eyes on Jesus for a life of joy and purpose.
Have you ever tried to make a perfectly straight line of footprints? It’s not as easy as you might think! Most people would tread slow and steady, heads down, focusing intensely on their feet.
But whenever someone faces this challenge with eyes downward, those footprints will be crooked. If you walk while staring at your feet, you’ll actually have no idea where you’re going. Perspective will be lacking because you can’t see how you fit into the larger landscape. Genuine focus is missing, since every step treads over the last step’s focal point.
The only way to make a straight line of footprints is to ignore your feet. Instead, look directly ahead and find a fence post, street sign, or tree in the distance. Then, with your eyes fixed on that target, walk toward it. If you’ve locked your focus on something other than yourself, the path will be much closer to straight.
The same is true in a spiritual sense. If we walk through life concentrating inwardly, we will miss the bigger picture and likely go off course. But when we focus beyond ourselves, fixing our thoughts on Jesus Christ, we can trust our path will be straight and trustworthy every step of the way (Isaiah 26:3).
