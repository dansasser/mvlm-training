We are most like our Savior when we die to self and serve others.
As we saw yesterday, Jesus—God made flesh—didn’t insist on the position and privileges that were rightly His. Instead, He emptied Himself and became a servant. But He didn’t stop at token humility: He took this step all the way to death—in fact, the excruciating and demeaning death by crucifixion. This is a powerful statement of God’s character. What the Lord delights in is not arrogance but a servant’s heart.
Jesus set aside power to serve in humility. As believers, we want to gain in Christlikeness, so shouldn’t humble service be our goal as well? To avoid losing sight of this calling, let’s keep in mind the lengths our Father went to: He reached into death and raised Jesus to new life—resurrection life. God highly exalted the Savior, giving Him the name above every name.
Even if we somehow miss the breathtaking scope of the Savior’s love and service during His life on earth, it will be clear when He returns. Philippians 2:10 says that every knee will bow before Jesus. The phrase “in heaven and on earth and under the earth” indicates that everything will worship Him as Lord.
In God’s view, the way up is down. We don’t please or honor Him by exalting ourselves. Rather, we pour out what we have in service and humility, to the glory of God the Father.
