Making Changes to Fulfill God’s Plan
In exchanging our will for God's, we discover what is truly good and satisfying in life.
As God’s adopted children, we have been given the purpose of glorifying Him through righteous living. Yesterday we saw this means making certain modifications in our life. Let’s consider two more changes that may be necessary for followers of Jesus.
1. One adjustment has to do with our belief system—a Christian’s thinking ought to match Jesus’. For example, students of Scripture will learn the following: The Lord is the One who deserves our praise (Psalm 96:4); the last shall be first (Mark 9:35); and Christians are to be generous people (1 Timothy 6:18). Our actions need to match what the Bible teaches.
2. We may also have to redefine our commitments. God is to be our highest priority, and His desires for us should take precedence over personal preferences and what others ask us to do. We must evaluate our choices in light of His plan for us. This may mean letting go of a favorite activity, taking on a new responsibility, or staying where we are despite longing to leave. Our Father wants and deserves His children’s full devotion (Matthew 22:37).
These changes do not all happen instantly at salvation; they take place over a lifetime. And we should be encouraged, because such adjustments are accompanied by the confidence of knowing that God will use us to fulfill His plan.
