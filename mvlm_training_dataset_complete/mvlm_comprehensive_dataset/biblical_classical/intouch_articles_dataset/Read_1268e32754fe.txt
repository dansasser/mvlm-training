On the cross, Christ made it possible for us to enter into a relationship with God—and now we are never alone.
Despite the fact that technology enables us to stay connected with each other, many are still lonely. The real solution for healing the ache of isolation is an intimate relationship with the Lord.
As He was about to create Adam, God said, “Let Us make man in Our image” (Genesis 1:26). Humanity was created to commune with the Father. Adam and Eve had a close bond with the Lord, but their disobedience caused a rift in the relationship. Once sin entered the world through the first couple, every person born would be tainted with it and, consequently, would be separated from God (Isaiah 59:2). Yet because of His love, the Lord planned a way to bridge the gap between Himself and mankind.
Jesus took our transgressions upon Himself when He died at Calvary, wiping away the stain of sin. Whoever trusts in His sacrifice for the forgiveness of sin is able to traverse the gulf bridged by the cross. Each new believer is reconciled—that is, immediately restored to a right relationship with the Lord.
Reconciliation with the Lord means that we are never alone (Deuteronomy 31:6). We may still feel lonely on occasion, but God’s indwelling Holy Spirit (John 14:17) is our constant companion, and He will provide comfort to our heart.
