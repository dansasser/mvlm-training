Jesus always loves us—and is always available to help us.
Believers think of the Savior as Lord, King, or Master, but how often do we think of Jesus as our friend? We may have difficulty with the concept, but He doesn’t. Jesus ...
Accepts us. Unconditional acceptance means we can always approach Him. He may want us to become more Christlike, but we are still accepted no matter what is happening in our life.
Walks through trials with us. God promises never to leave or forsake His people (Deuteronomy 31:6; Hebrews 13:5). He is our constant encourager and faithful friend during both the good and dark times in our life.
Is always available. He’s never too busy to meet our needs or respond to our prayers.
Listens to us. We can share our doubts, fears, and joys with the Lord because He cares about what’s on our mind and wants to hear from us. Whatever we say—even angry shouts and tears—will be consistently met with assurance of His love.
We can take comfort in knowing the Lord has a plan for each believer and will take care of us. Thank Him today for the way He looks out for us. As the old hymn says, “What a friend we have in Jesus!”
