The love we give will always have more impact in our world than the words we say.
If you’ve received Jesus as your Savior, then the One who raised Him from the dead—the Holy Spirit—resides within you (Romans 8:11)! Just think about the unsurpassed power needed to bring about the resurrection. And now God’s Spirit pours His energy into producing godliness in all who follow the Lord.
In Galatians 5:22-23, we read about the “fruit of the Spirit”—the character and conduct produced by the Holy Spirit. These are qualities that we can’t generate consistently on our own. Especially in this Christmas season, the most powerful message we can give isn’t a testimony or sermon; it’s the way we live our life. The world doesn’t need more festive decorations or empty songs. Instead, it needs to witness godly families loving one another, businesspeople working with integrity and frugality, and believers serving their neighbors.
By showing peace instead of anxiety, or patience instead of frustration, a Christian bears witness to the beauty of God’s good news. The strongest gospel message doesn’t necessarily come from a pulpit; it comes from wherever you work, live, and relax—because of Jesus Christ in you. During the next few weeks and on into the New Year, be mindful of the message you preach through your words and actions.
