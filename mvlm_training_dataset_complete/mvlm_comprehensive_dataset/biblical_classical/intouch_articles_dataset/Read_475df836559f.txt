Sunday Check-In With Dr. Stanley: Standing Before God’s Open Door
How is God leading you to share His love with others?
The apostle Paul had passion and vision to reach the world with the truth of salvation. As he followed the Holy Spirit’s leading, traveling more than 10,000 miles in a few short years, he managed to share the gospel with people all the way from Jerusalem to Rome. There’s no telling how many lives the Lord has (and will continue to) transform through that one man.
Paul was faced with a big task in a time when there was no mass communication. He could teach only a few thousand people at a time, and his letters, which were widely shared in the early church, could reach thousands more.
Compared to the apostle, we have far more ways to communicate—radio, television, print resources, and the internet—and through them, we can reach millions of people around the world. Even countries closed to the gospel are within reach. How can you play a part in the Great Commission and encourage others to join in doing the work (Matthew 28:18-20)? The door of opportunity is wide open for us to share the good news. We just need to step through it and see all the amazing things God has in store.
