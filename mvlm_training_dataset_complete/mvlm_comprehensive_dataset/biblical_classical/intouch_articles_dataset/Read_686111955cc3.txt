It Is Good to Be Afflicted
One day, we will look back and praise God for the trials that shaped us.
The psalmist rejoiced in affliction because trials added to his knowledge of God. His heart and spirit were enriched as well. To him, the resulting lessons about the Lord’s constancy, grace, and righteousness were more valuable than a sack filled with gold and silver.
Affliction has a powerful impact on a believer’s faith. Consider how David’s pursuit of the Lord developed while he was running from Saul. The years between his victory over Goliath and his ascension to the throne were demanding and draining. The challenges that David faced molded him into a wise leader, a skilled warrior, and a humble servant of the Lord.
The psalms reveal that David’s struggles taught him dependence, perseverance, and many other valuable spiritual traits. The Lord also provided comfort even as He stretched His servant’s faith (Psalm 86:17). By means of affliction, God molds us into people who can comfort others (2 Corinthians 1:4). The message we share with them is: God is enough. He’s sufficient to meet our needs when the pit is deep, the obstacle high, and the suffering prolonged.
2 Corinthians 2:14 tells us that believers are a sweet aroma on the earth. We carry cheer to the discouraged, relief to the hurting, and the message of Christ’s love to all.
