No Condemnation; Only Love
Everything that could be used to denounce us before God was placed upon Jesus at the cross.
The Father’s love for His children is so wide, long, high, and deep that we can never fully fathom its extent (Ephesians 3:17-19). God’s love is constant—and it is forever. But sometimes our feelings might tell us otherwise.
In our mind, we often correlate divine love with our behavior. When we have been good, we believe we are loved. But when we make mistakes, we question how much God cares for us. After a series of missteps, we might conclude His disapproval of us far outweighs His approval.
The truth is, there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ. As our loving heavenly Father, God can and does use discipline to bring us back into alignment with His will for our life (Hebrews 12:7). He also allows us to experience the consequences of sin. However, divine condemnation is not one of them.
Everything that could be used to denounce us before Almighty God was placed upon Jesus at the cross. According to the Father’s perfect plan, His Son took our place so we could be set free: In Christ, we are healed from the sickness of sin that once separated us from the Lover of our souls. The Savior’s sacrifice allows us the joy of knowing God and experiencing His presence forever.
