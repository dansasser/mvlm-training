Every need is an opportunity to trust God and discover that He really does provide.
No one likes to be in need. But from the Lord’s perspective, that situation can be spiritually beneficial. When the bottom drops out of our imaginary security bubble, we discover the reality that all provision comes from Him. The Lord uses various instruments to meet needs, but He alone is the source of everything.
Elijah had learned to live by faith in the unusual ways of the Lord: he’d been fed by ravens. Now God sent him to Zarephath, to a starving widow with no ability to feed him. Every financial need is an opportunity to learn to walk by faith in the Lord, trusting Him to be our source. Prosperity can lead to a sense of independence that blinds us to how inadequate we actually are to provide for ourselves. But in reality, we’re totally dependent upon the Father whether we know it or not.
Believing that God would provide for him, Elijah was able to witness miraculous divine intervention. We may not see the Lord perform a supernatural work in our finances. However, His Word tells us, “My God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus” (Philippians 4:19).
Are you focusing on the instrument or the source of your provision? The means God uses may change, but His faithfulness endures forever. The Lord is inviting you to trust Him and live in both the adventure and security of a life of faith.
