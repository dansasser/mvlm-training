Make it a habit to notice the many reasons you have for loving the Lord.
Do you ever wonder why you exist? Day-to-day activities and worries pull us in so many directions that most of us seldom think about the goal of life. But our Creator made us with a purpose: to glorify Him (Isaiah 43:7).
In His Word, God tells us to testify to His faithfulness and His mighty works. Jesus considered this important as well—when teaching His disciples how to communicate with God, He began His prayer with adoration of His Father (Matthew 6:9).
That is why we should give as much attention to praising the Lord as we do to making petitions. It can be challenging to prioritize worship when we sit down to pray. In fact, doing so might even feel awkward now and then. Yet Psalm 103:2 tells us to remember God’s benefits so we will glorify Him. This psalm also shows us how to lift the Father up with our words—specifically, we should praise God for His character and His work (vv. 2-8, 19).
When’s the last time you simply praised the Lord? Observe how the Father is exalted in the Psalms and throughout the Scriptures. Then worship Him with praise as you spend time basking in His presence.
