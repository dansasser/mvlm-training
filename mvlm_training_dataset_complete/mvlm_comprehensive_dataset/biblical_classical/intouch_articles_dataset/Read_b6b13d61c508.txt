God can use input from others to help you grow—even when it is offered incorrectly.
Nobody likes criticism. It’s often unsolicited and rarely fun. Yet God can take even a wrong attitude, bad timing, or harsh tone of voice and still tell us something we need to hear.
That’s why we’re wise to pay attention when people judge us negatively. Invited or not, criticism gives us an opportunity to examine ourselves, take notice of weak areas, and avoid unnecessary mistakes. If we fail to listen, our potential for mental, emotional, and spiritual growth is limited (Proverbs 15:31).
While not all opinions are valid, it’s important to respond well and evaluate criticism correctly. First, do not immediately reject the comment or defend yourself. Instead, consider what was said and ask God if He’s trying to tell you something. Then, thank the person for the interest in your growth, and reflect on the observation. Next, evaluate the criticism and determine what exactly is under scrutiny—your beliefs, your character, your behavior, or God? Finally, view this as an opportunity for growth, and, if necessary, apologize to the person you’ve offended.
Jesus died on the cross for us, so we as believers are certain of His acceptance. When we remember this, the disapproval of others will feel less significant and hurtful. And as we learn to respond correctly, we’ll be blessed to find ourselves growing.
