Your Perspective in Prayer
If we come to the Lord with a submissive heart, we will hear from Him.
Why is it that two believers can pray about an issue and come away with completely different responses and attitudes? The truth is that we each come to God with our own life experiences and expectations. If we want to hear His voice clearly, we must first address three things that affect how well we listen:
Our relationship with the Lord. Neither God nor the fundamentals of faith change, but He does tailor His message to individual believers based on their spiritual maturity and situation.
Our understanding of who God is. How we view the Lord affects the way we hear Him. For example, if you see God as a loving Father, you will hear His encouraging voice and accept His loving discipline. But if you see Him as harsh, then you may feel as though you can never live up to His expectations.
Our attitude toward God. Naturally, if we come to the Lord with a proud nature, we won’t be inclined to hear His voice. However, if we come with a submissive heart, we’ll hear His Word and joyfully receive it (Psalms 119:97-98).
God is still speaking in the world today. Take a moment to think about anything that might get in the way of your receiving His message. Whatever the hindrance, lay it before the Lord and ask to hear Him more clearly.
