Ask the Lord to help you see those who need your welcome today.
Even though Jesus had no home to call His own, the Gospel accounts reveal His ability to make others feel at home in His presence. Wherever the Lord went, He intentionally welcomed those with open hearts and “ears to hear”—including sinners and tax collectors—into the household and family of God.
Although Zacchaeus was a tax collector well known for extortion, Jesus countered his sin with generosity. In this way, the Lord showed that true hospitality doesn’t come from material resources, but from a heart that sees and serves others with God’s love. “Hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house,” Jesus declared as He looked up at the tree where the man had climbed for a better view (Luke 19:5). Imagine Zacchaeus’ surprise to find that Jesus sought him out, even though he was in an unlikely place. This is true for us, too; no matter how small or unnoticed we may feel, God sees us and loves us.
Jesus’ hospitality prompted Zacchaeus’ own display of generous hospitality. When we show others that we see them and God sees them too, hearts and lives are transformed. Understanding and embracing God’s hospitality toward us—no matter how great our sin—enables us to extend that same hospitality to others as we invite them to join us at Jesus’ table.
