Victory Over Weakness
God is an inexhaustible source of hope and strength when we seek to resist temptation.
Samson is an example of someone who drifted away from the Lord. He had a righteous upbringing, with parents who taught him how to obey God, but in time the temptations of the world became overly attractive to him.
Scripture reveals several occasions where Samson gave into sin. For instance, he desired a pagan woman from Timnah and despite his parents’ warning, broke God’s command by marrying her (Judges 14:1-3). Another time, he was enraged by his wife’s manipulation and killed 30 men (Judges 14:12-20). Perhaps the most tragic example is his pursuit of another Philistine woman, Delilah, whose betrayal led to Samson being captured and blinded.
Left unchecked, sin will permeate and dominate our life, while also affecting others with its repercussions. The first step toward victory over temptation is to become aware of our weaknesses. Next, we must admit helplessness to overcome them on our own. Finally, it’s important to acknowledge God’s sufficiency to rescue us.
In the end, Samson recognized his need for God and prayed for strength to strike back at the Philistines (Judg. 16:28). The sooner we share Samson’s final perspective, the better—living obediently is the way to triumph over sin.
