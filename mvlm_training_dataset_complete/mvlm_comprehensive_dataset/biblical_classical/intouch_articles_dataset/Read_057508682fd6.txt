Facing Life’s Unknowns
When we know and trust the Lord, we don't have to fear change and uncertainty.
Moses knew what it was to live with uncertainty. He was born in Egypt at a time when the growing Hebrew population was seen as a threat. So to protect Moses, his family let others raise him. But then, as an adult, he had to flee his homeland.
Later, in a personal encounter with the Lord, Moses learned that he was God’s choice to be the Israelites’ leader. In this new role—one for which he felt woefully ill-equipped—he had to stand before Pharaoh and demand his people’s release. And as if that weren’t enough, he had to lead more than a million slaves—each of them depending on him—to the Promised Land.
Yet Moses steadfastly carried on. Scripture tells us he was able to persevere because of faith, which Hebrews 11:1 defines as “confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see” (NIV). Moses had learned how to see “Him who is unseen” (Heb. 11:27). As a result, he was able to grasp the reality of the Lord’s character and promises. After encountering the Lord at the burning bush (Exodus 3:2), he understood his purpose was to rely on God and follow His plan.
Though Moses wasn’t perfect, the Scriptures commend him for walking by faith. From his example, we can learn how to persevere through life’s unknowns with the help of the Holy Spirit.
