Our Great High Priest
Our compassionate Savior understands our weaknesses.
Have you ever wondered why some people face hardships with confidence and boldness while others feel plagued by doubts and fear? Perhaps one reason for uncertainty is an inadequate view of who Jesus is. We know He’s our Lord and Savior, but how many of us know Him as our Great High Priest?
Hebrews 4:15 tells us, “For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things just as we are, yet without sin.” Jesus enters into our life and experiences our suffering, pain, and guilt right along with us. Have you ever been misunderstood when you did your best? Consider this: Was anybody more misunderstood than Jesus? He was personally acquainted with that kind of pain. Has somebody you loved ever said no, shut the door, and walked away? Jesus experienced this, too. His own people scorned Him. And does Jesus, the sinless One, understand our feelings of regret and shame? The Bible tells us that the Father laid all the sins of the world on Him. Jesus Christ bore the guilt of all mankind.
No matter what you are facing, realize that the Savior identifies with your circumstance, feels every single thing you’re experiencing, and will walk by your side.
