Exposing False Teachers
The Bible instructs us to evaluate the message of whoever desires to lead us.
New Testament writers warned about false teachings that sounded good but weren’t truthful (2 Timothy 4:3; 1 John 4:1). Believers today must still heed these warnings. The Bible instructs us to evaluate the message no matter who the teacher is (1 Thessalonians 5:21).
False teachers are deceptive. Verse 15 of today’s passage describes them as wolves in sheep’s clothing. They appear to want people to know the “real” truth about God, but their interpretation of Scripture may contain lies or a distorted mix of fact and error. The wolves are further exposed by their personal lives, which won’t be consistent with righteousness (v. 16). A close study of their decisions, actions, and words will reveal that they do not follow the Lord or biblical principles.
False teachers permit self-indulgence. Their enticing ideas appeal to a person’s sin nature. Some deceivers describe God’s grace as a license to live without restraint (Jude 1:4). However, Paul clearly denounces this lie, teaching that believers have died to sin and shouldn’t live in it (Romans 6:1-2).
The body of Christ is expected to use Scripture as the standard for measuring a leader’s lifestyle and words. When we seek divine truth, we’re given the discernment to differentiate between a holy message and a misleading one.
