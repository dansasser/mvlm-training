Claiming a Promise of God
While you're waiting for God to move, ask Him to help you grow in faith, obedience, and patience.
God’s promises are precious (2 Pet. 1:4). Not only do they remind us of His personal interest in our life, but they also provide hope and encouragement during difficult times.
Before claiming a promise, we must check ourselves in three areas: faith, obedience, and patience. First, we must trust Jesus as our personal Savior. Next, we must obey God. As discussed in yesterday’s devotion, our obedience or action is required in order to claim conditional promises.  Finally, patience is required. God operates on His timetable to accomplish His purposes according to His perfect plan.
At times it may seem as if a divine promise is not being fulfilled. When that is the case, take another look at the biblical passage to be sure it applies to you. Then verify that you have met the necessary conditions. If you are still convinced the promise applies, look a little deeper at your request. Will God be honored when this promise is fulfilled? Will it help you grow spiritually? These additional questions will assist you in claiming a promise.
The Holy Spirit will build our faith through Scripture, provide the strength necessary to obey, and develop in us the fruit of patience. These qualities are necessary and will help us as we look to God to fulfill His promises.
