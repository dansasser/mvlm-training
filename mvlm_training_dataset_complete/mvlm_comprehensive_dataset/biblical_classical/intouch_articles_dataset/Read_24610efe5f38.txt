God doesn’t leave anyone out—He gives everyone the opportunity to become part of His family.
We were created to share a relationship with God—that’s why He has made His existence clear to everyone. Sometimes His revelation is miraculous, like the burning bush that Moses discovered. But more often than not, we encounter our Father’s presence in everyday surroundings.
Paul wrote to the church in Rome that “[God’s] invisible attributes, that is, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, being understood by what has been made” (Rom. 1:20). In other words, the Lord is evident in every created thing. Have you ever wondered how an old oak survives season after season? Have you marveled at the starry sky or watched a colony of ants work together? All such things point us to the Lord.
God made His presence evident in nature because He “wants all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth” (1 Timothy 2:4). He has given us the capacity to be aware of Him through what He has made. However, the Father has also given every person the choice of whether to accept or reject a relationship with Him.
What will you do the next time you see evidence of the Lord in your world? Scripture promises we won’t regret knowing Jesus. After all, He wants us to “have life, and have it abundantly” (John 10:10).
