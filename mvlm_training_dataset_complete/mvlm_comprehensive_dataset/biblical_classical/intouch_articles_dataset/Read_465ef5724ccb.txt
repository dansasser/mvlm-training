The Importance of Baptism
When we follow Christ into the water to be baptized, we publicly proclaim our allegiance to Him.
Think back to when you were a child. Do you remember imitating an older person you looked up to? It’s common for children to adopt mannerisms, speech patterns, and ideas of people they admire, but in time, many outgrow these behaviors. We, however, as children of God, are never to stop emulating and being closely identified with Jesus. And one way we follow His example is through baptism.
In Matthew 28, Jesus tells His disciples: “Go ... and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit” (Matthew 28:19). At the beginning of His public ministry, Jesus chose to be baptized. John the Baptist was calling the people to confess their sins and repent—and then to be immersed in the Jordan River as an outward sign of that decision. Jesus, the One who had no sin, joined the crowd at the river and asked John to baptize Him. By following His example in the waters of baptism, we are publicly confessing our faith in the Savior and identifying ourselves with Him.
It’s important to remember that baptism isn’t required for salvation—only faith in the Lord is. But through baptism, we demonstrate our connection with Jesus and our brothers and sisters in Christ. We are all members of one body, following in His footsteps.
