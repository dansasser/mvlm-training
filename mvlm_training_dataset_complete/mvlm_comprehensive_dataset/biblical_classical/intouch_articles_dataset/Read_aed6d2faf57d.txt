Holding On to Our Hope
Give your hopes and dreams to God—and then wait to see Him deliver something better.
Hannah’s situation seemed hopeless. She was heartbroken because she was childless, which was a source of disgrace for a Hebrew woman. Holding on to hope can be difficult when circumstances show no signs of improving. For believers, this can be even more discouraging because they know God could have fulfilled their hopes and remedied the situation, but He hasn’t.
Hannah was a woman of great faith, even in the midst of disappointment and pain. Year after year she kept going to Shiloh to worship the Lord. Perseverance like hers is a quality the Father highly values in His people. Endurance in trials leads to godly character and hope that “does not disappoint” (Romans 5:3-5).
Great pain often drives us to God. Weeping bitterly, Hannah poured out her soul before the Lord and offered a sacrifice of the very thing she valued most—a child. She laid her hope at His feet and promised that if He fulfilled her desire, she’d give her son to be God’s servant.
Sometimes what we strive to hold can be kept only by surrendering it to God (Luke 9:24). May we learn from Hannah’s example of faith and pour out our heart to God. Let us release our hopes to the only One who can fulfill our desires or change them to match His will.
