God has a purpose for your life—and it's more wonderful than you can imagine.
Let the words from today’s reading slowly sink in: “able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think” (Eph. 3:20). What an amazing description of the Lord’s ability to work within us. Yet so often our focus is mainly on what we want Him to do—namely, that if He’d change this or fix that, then our life would be better. But He invites us to think and ask bigger—He wants to change us!
The Holy Spirit has more than enough power to transform lives from the inside out, but change within is usually a slow process. Spiritual fruit takes time to grow and mature. That’s why we need patience and faith to believe God is working even when results aren’t evident.
God has a purpose for your life, and He is constantly working to achieve it. He also has an overarching goal—to conform every believer to the image of His Son (Romans 8:29). In order to do this, He may have to bring us through some struggles and heartaches. It might make no sense to us, but God knows exactly what He’s doing.
What would you like to see the Lord do within you? As you read the Scriptures, look for qualities that God considers precious, and ask Him to work them out in your life. Then rely on His wonderful promise to do even more than you have asked or imagined.
