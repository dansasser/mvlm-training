God is slow to anger and gives us time to repent, but He loves us too much to let us continue in sin.
Just as a toddler has to learn obedience, God’s children also must learn to walk in His ways. He takes pleasure in watching us do what is right and wants to help us when we go wrong. Therefore, He is patient and allows us time and room for mistakes.
Paul appreciated God’s patience. His life demonstrated that because the Father is slow to anger, unbelievers have a much greater opportunity for salvation (1 Tim. 1:16). In Romans 2:4, Paul affirms that our heavenly Father’s kindness and mercy lead to repentance. But in the next verse, he warns those with stubborn hearts that they will experience judgment.
Let’s look at the nation of Israel. In the Old Testament, they repeatedly experienced this painful truth. They turned away from the Lord and did evil in His sight by worshipping idols. Eventually, He’d withdraw His protection until they would cry out and return to Him. Ultimately, even when the Lord allows calamity to reach His children, it is still drenched with His love and purpose.
If there is unconfessed sin in your life, ask God to forgive you and help you turn from it. Then thank Him for His patience and lovingkindness.
