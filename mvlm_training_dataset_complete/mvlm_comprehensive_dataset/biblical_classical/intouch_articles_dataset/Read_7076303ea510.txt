We can't even begin to comprehend the awesome majesty and power of our Lord.
When you think of God, what comes to mind? Often, we tend to view Him in the way that best fits our particular need or situation. For example, if we struggle with guilt, we might focus on His forgiveness. The truth is, His character encompasses far more than we could ever comprehend or try to explain. Even if we had all the time in the world, we wouldn’t be able to do more than scratch the surface of how awesome He is. But today, let’s look at one attribute: His greatness.
Today’s passage tells us God is greater than creation (v. 12), for it was by His hands that everything we see came into being. He is higher than the nations or any idol fashioned by the finest craftsman (vv. 17-20). In fact, God is above the world and all mankind (vv. 22-23), surpassing even the heavens and galaxies.
Our Father’s thoughts and ways are far grander than our own (Isaiah 55:9)—and lofty, compared with what we can understand. Psalm 93:1 says, “The Lord reigns, He is clothed with majesty; the Lord has clothed and encircled Himself with strength.”
Consider the awesome God we serve. He truly is worthy of our praise. As we grasp even a fraction of His greatness, our response should be one of humble worship. After all, who are we that a God like this would desire our friendship—so much so that He sent His Son to die for our sins?
