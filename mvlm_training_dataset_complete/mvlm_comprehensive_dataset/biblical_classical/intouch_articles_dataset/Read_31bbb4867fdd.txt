If you want to lead well, follow Jesus.
There’s an adage about parenting that says more things are caught than taught. In other words, our children will pick up more from what we do than what we say. To lead those in our care well, two things are required: right teaching and a right attitude. While the principles we work to instill in our children are vital, the attitude with which we approach those lessons (and all of life, in fact) is key. For the best example of the right attitude to have, we need look no further than Jesus.
Parents are called to lead those in their home, modeling Jesus’ love and sacrifice for the people entrusted to their care. Our kids need to see us spending time with God, turning to Scripture when making decisions, being generous with our resources, and showing love to the people around us. Children learn to walk with God as they watch us apply His principles in daily life. Our right example will build their confidence and trust in His ways.
Even if you aren’t a parent, it’s likely you’re leading others in your circle of influence. Remember that Jesus is the perfect model for us to emulate as we share God’s truth with those around us (Mark 10:42-45). Lean into His example of servant leadership as you teach, train, and love others well. And ask Him to help you grow in godliness each and every day.
