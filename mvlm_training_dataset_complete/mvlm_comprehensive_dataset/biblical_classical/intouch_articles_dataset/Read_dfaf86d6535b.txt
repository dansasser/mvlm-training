Wise people take the time to verify information before choosing a course of action.
Hanun, the king of the Ammonites, reacted to misinformation. His father had just died, so King David sent some servants to offer condolences. But Hanun’s commanders convinced him that the visitors were spies coming to scope out his land. Without checking whether the accusation was true, he abused and mocked David’s servants, which led to a war.
We’ve likely done something similar (though, thankfully, it didn’t lead to battle). Maybe we reacted to a rumor before confirming the information. Or perhaps we failed to ask clarifying questions. And at one point or another, most of us have responded too quickly to a situation—striking back, like a frightened animal, before taking time to consider the godly response. And our reaction probably caused hurt feelings or embarrassment.
Yet wisdom instructs us to respond differently. There are countless passages of Scripture discussing the value of wisdom and how to acquire it from God. Spend some time this week looking up a few. Take notes on the ones that resonate most and see if you can find any common themes. Then ask God to teach you how to respond to others more slowly, with grace and wisdom (James 1:19-20).
