In a World of Quick, Slow Is Good
Let's give others—and ourselves—time to learn and grow.
Have you ever gotten into the far left lane on the highway so you can move just a little faster—only to have the cars in front of you slow down? Then you’re stuck between a divider wall on your left and even slower traffic on your right, feeling frustrated and annoyed.
Sometimes we want to treat our spiritual growth like that—jumping into that fast lane to “beat” everyone else to the goal and reach our destination sooner. We think that by reading a specific book or praying a certain way, we’ll grow more quickly and get to the next thing. But then the trials of life come, and without a strong foundation—one that’s built over time and with diligence—we quickly become overwhelmed and disillusioned.
In a world of quick, remember that slow growth is a good thing. Consider today’s passage, where Paul describes believers as children who must “grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, that is, Christ” (v. 15). We don’t expect children to do everything like adults. It takes time for them to develop the strength, coordination, and intelligence required for “adult” tasks. When we become Christians, the process is similar. No one becomes a fully mature believer overnight—nor does God expect us to. So let’s be patient with ourselves, take the time required to “grow up,” and celebrate when we see progress in ourselves.
