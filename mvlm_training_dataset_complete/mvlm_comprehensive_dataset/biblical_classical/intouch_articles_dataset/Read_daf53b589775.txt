The Power of Scriptural Prayer
Praying Scripture for loved ones guarantees that our petitions reflect God's heart.
One of the greatest things we can do is lift a person up in prayer. And there is no more powerful way to do this than to speak Scripture on his or her behalf. Colossians 1:9-10 is a beautiful example of what to pray as we bring loved ones before God’s throne.
The apostle Paul wrote today’s passage to the church at Colossae. From this, we know the specific requests he brought before God concerning his brothers and sisters in the faith. These are applicable to us today as well. Let’s focus on the first two requests today and the remaining four tomorrow.
First, Paul asked for the believers to understand God’s plan for their lives. We must remember that the Lord often does not reveal everything at once, but He does give seeking hearts enough information to trust and follow His path.
Second, the apostle prayed that the believers in Colossae would conduct themselves in a manner worthy of Christ. Paul longed to see them remain consistent with their identity in the Lord and to produce spiritual fruit (Galatians 5:22-23).
When you begin to pray as Paul does here, your intercessions will change—and so will you.
