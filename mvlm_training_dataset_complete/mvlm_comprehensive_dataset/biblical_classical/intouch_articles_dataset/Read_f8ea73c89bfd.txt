Repentance in the Believer’s Life
When we are truly grieved by our sin, God cleanses our heart and provides the power to change.
Is repentance necessary in the Christian’s life? Yes, and we can see this truth in 1 John 1:9: “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous, so that He will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” You may say, “The word repentance isn’t in that verse.” But let’s take a closer look.
Remember, “to repent” simply means to change your mind. For non-Christians, this refers to saving faith—the decision to place trust in Jesus. But for believers, repentance involves a change of heart with regard to behavior or attitude. It is an ongoing decision to lead an obedient, Christlike life.
In 1 John, this choice is represented by the word confess, which means “to agree with.” In other words, if you confess your wrongdoing to God, you are coming into agreement with Him about that sin and therefore disagreeing with your previous view. Here, confession isn’t a matter of salvation; rather, it means allowing the Father to continually re-form your mind, molding you more and more into the image of His Son. As God continues to work in your life, your mind will gradually reject old thought patterns, and you’ll more closely represent His way of thinking.
Is there sin in your life that has become too uncomfortable to bear? Confess it and allow God to change your heart today.
