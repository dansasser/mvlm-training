When you trust God, there's no limit to what He can do through your life.
When we continually spend time with God in His Word, His presence will saturate our heart, making us sensitive and teachable. But just as a human relationship can grow cold unless we intentionally nurture it, the heart can gradually harden when we aren’t seeking intimacy with God. For our heart to stay soft and receptive, we must obediently—and promptly—respond to whatever the Lord tells us to do.
If you believe that God might be leading you in a certain direction, take the time to earnestly seek His mind on the matter and intentionally listen for His response. Then avoid getting busy with a substitute for what He originally called you to do. It would be tragic to work hard doing what you and others consider good, only to discover that you accomplished something that was not God’s intention.
Resisting the Lord often amounts to setting His purposes for your life on a shelf. And that will likely leave you feeling something is missing. There’s no substitute for God’s will, even when His plan might seem difficult or impossible. But when you trustfully approach God with a cooperative heart, there’s no limit to what He can accomplish through your life. So, step out in obedience today and say, “Lord, I want Your will—no matter what.”
