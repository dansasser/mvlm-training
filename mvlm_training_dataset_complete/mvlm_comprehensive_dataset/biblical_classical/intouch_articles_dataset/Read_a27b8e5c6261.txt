Equipped for the Valley
God's Word builds the foundation we need for withstanding life’s storms.
It is tough to remember everything we learn from the Bible, but the more we retain, the more wisdom we’ll be able to recall during tough times. And toward that end, writing can become a powerful tool in our spiritual walk. Putting words on paper etches wisdom deeper into the heart and mind, which helps build a solid biblical foundation.
Consider King David, who wrote many of the psalms. He had a consistent habit of recording truths about God. As a result, he was equipped for hardship. In yesterday’s psalm, for example, David said that he did not fear evil (Psalm 23:4). What did he have to be scared of when the One who controls everything was on his side (Ps. 27:1)? How could he be stifled by anxiety while in the Spirit’s comforting presence (Psalm 34:4)? David held God to His promises, but he had to know those assurances in order to rely on them.
Writing is not necessary for our walk with God, but when we’re struggling, it can help us remember valuable truths— such as the fact that God is upholding us (Isaiah 41:10) and our hardship has purpose (Romans 5:3). As we recall these spiritual realities, our faith is strengthened. Then we can face subsequent challenges with a more solid foundation of trust.
