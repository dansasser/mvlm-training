The Advantages of Accountability
Have you found a wise Christian friend to help you stay balanced and pursue righteousness?
At times, people make a mistake by ignoring wise boundaries. But a godly accountability partner can share wisdom to help us avoid such missteps. This type of relationship has valuable benefits:
Clearer direction. Being honest about faults and failures will lead us to pursue right counsel and encouragement.
Increased integrity. If we have to give an account to somebody, we’re more likely to live transparently (Proverbs 10:9).
Better stewardship. Being answerable for the way we use our money, time, and talent makes us steward those resources more carefully.
Defense against excess. As believers, we’re free in Christ, but an accountability partner helps us to stay balanced and pursue righteousness.
Healthy self-examination. Another person can often point out what we cannot see in ourselves.
Protection against unwise relationships. If we have someone who can help us consider which people to spend time with, we’ll be more likely to avoid problematic situations.
Do you check in regularly with someone wise? If not, consider inviting a trustworthy Christian to fill that role. Taking this step reveals a heart that longs to please God.
