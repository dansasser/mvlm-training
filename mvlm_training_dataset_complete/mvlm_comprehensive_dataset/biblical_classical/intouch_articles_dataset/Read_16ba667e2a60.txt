God's intense, protective love is beyond the profound love of human parents for their children.
One of the most intense expressions of human love is the protective instinct parents have toward their children. There is little that most moms and dads wouldn’t do for their child.
Wouldn’t you like to be cared for with that kind of intensity? You are. In fact, the Lord’s love toward you is far deeper and more secure than that of even the most caring, tuned-in human parent. And what God did for us is proof. Romans 5:8 says that while we were living in disobedience, He sent His only Son to die on the cross for us.
If we accept this gift and decide to follow the Lord, He justifies us, makes us righteous, and changes our ultimate destiny: Instead of facing everlasting separation from Him, we will enjoy His presence eternally. What’s more, Almighty God adopts us as His children permanently. Our heavenly Father guides, protects, and counsels us as we walk through life—and promises us that we are secure in Him forever.
How incredible that the Creator of the universe would love us in this way! Have you experienced the security and joy of His care? Gratitude and praise should flow from your heart. In turn, love others deeply out of thankfulness for the love that you have received.
