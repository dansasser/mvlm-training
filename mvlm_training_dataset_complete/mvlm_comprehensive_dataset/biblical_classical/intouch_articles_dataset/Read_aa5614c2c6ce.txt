Our God, clothed with majesty and power, is truly worthy of our praise.
When you think of God, what comes to mind? People often view Him in the way that best fits their particular need or situation. The truth is, His character encompasses far more than we could ever comprehend or try to explain. At the same time, it is important to look at Scripture in order to learn all we can about the One we worship.
Today we’ll focus on one attribute: His greatness. Isaiah 40 tells us God is greater than creation (v. 12), for everything we see came into being by His hands. He is higher than the nations or any idol fashioned by the finest craftsman (vv. 15-20). In fact, He is above the entire world and all mankind, surpassing even the heavens and galaxies (vv. 22-23, 26).
Our Father’s thoughts and ways are far grander than our own (Isaiah 55:9) and lofty compared with what we can understand. Psalm 93:1 states, “The Lord reigns, He is clothed with majesty; the Lord has clothed and girded Himself with strength.”
Consider the awesome God we serve. He truly is worthy of our praise. When we grasp even a fraction of His greatness, our response should be humble worship. After all, who are we that a God like this would desire our friendship—so much so that He sent His Son to die for our sins?
