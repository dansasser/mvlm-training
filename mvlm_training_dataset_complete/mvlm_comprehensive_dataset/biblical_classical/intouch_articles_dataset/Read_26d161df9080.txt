Jesus’ Offer of Peace
Peace isn't dependent on circumstances—it's ours when we surrender to the Lord.
What gives us peace? Most people would say inner tranquility is dependent upon circumstances—like a solid relationship with a spouse, a well-paying job, or good health. But what happens when a couple fights, the company lays off employees, or sickness saps the body? Then, the serenity we thought we had crumbles, because peace rooted in good situations isn’t really peace at all.
Jesus is the only One who offers a deep, lasting contentment that is unshakeable. However, we cannot experience that genuine sense of calm unless we are living in His will. Submission to the Lord and His plans allows His peace to permeate our life.
When the Holy Spirit lives within us, we can approach each day confidently and serenely, but that happens only through a relationship with the Savior. The apostle Paul explains that to be justified—that is, declared no longer guilty—we must accept the sacrifice Christ made in our place. Justification makes us right with God and opens our hearts to His peace (Rom. 5:1).
If you haven’t yet acknowledged to God that you recognize His Son’s loving sacrifice was made on your behalf, now is the right time to surrender to Him.
