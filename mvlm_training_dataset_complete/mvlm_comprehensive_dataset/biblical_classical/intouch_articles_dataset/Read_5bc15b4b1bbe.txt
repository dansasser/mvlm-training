Remembering God’s Goodness
How can you create reminders of the Lord's faithfulness?
Joshua 3:10-17 - Joshua 4:1-8
Some information—like a birthday or phone number—is easy to remember. Yet we tend to forget examples of the Lord’s goodness to us. Today’s verses suggest a way to counteract this.
After bringing His people safely out of Egypt and through the Red Sea, God miraculously provided another dry path by piling up the Jordan’s waters in a heap upstream. He knew the Israelites were about to enter Jericho and would, by His power, overcome that city. It was certainly compassionate of God to give that tangible illustration of His strength and presence before the battle. But He also knew how quickly they had forgotten Him before.
The Lord had a plan to help His people recall the miracle at the river. He told them to create a memorial with 12 stones, each representing a tribe of Israel that had passed safely through the waters (Josh. 4:7-8). Then they would have a lasting visible reminder of divine rescue.
We’re much like the Israelites: When God works in big, obvious ways, it’s easy to trust Him. But in time, we drift toward self-reliance until we’re reminded of our need for Him and repent.
How can you create reminders of God’s faithfulness? Whether it’s by journaling or creating a “thankfulness list,” make sure you have a way to remember the Lord’s involvement in your life.
