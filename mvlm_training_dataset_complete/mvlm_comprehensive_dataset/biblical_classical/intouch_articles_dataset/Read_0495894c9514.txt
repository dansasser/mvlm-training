The Faith to Press On
Persevere and honor God through hardship—reward is on the other side.
When difficult times come into your life, what is your response? It may seem tempting to look for a way out of the discomfort, but that’s not the attitude God desires from us. He wants His children to press on and trust Him, even though that may not end the affliction.
This comes as a shock to many new believers. They are often surprised when a hardship appears. However, it’s a misconception to expect an easy life once we trust God’s Son as Lord. In fact, Jesus Himself said that the world will give us great trouble (John 16:33).
In James 1:2, we are instructed to consider our struggles as a source of “pure joy” (NIV). This makes sense only when we see our difficulties through God’s eyes, as opportunities for growth. When we face trials with wisdom and endure them with godly perseverance, we will find blessings we never thought possible.
At the end of the struggle, we will see God and receive our reward: the crown of life (v. 12). And this glorious end result is so much more than a mere object; it is eternal, perfect, and imperishable. Do you want the Lord’s recognition of your spiritual victory? Then press on through the hardship and discover what lies just beyond the trial.
