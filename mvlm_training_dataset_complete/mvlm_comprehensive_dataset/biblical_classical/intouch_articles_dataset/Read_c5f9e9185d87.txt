Fearfully and Wonderfully Made
The Lord sees beyond who you are to who you can be.
Looking at all He had created, God declared that it was very good (Genesis 1:31). We’ve been “awesomely and wonderfully made,” with great potential for service in His kingdom (Ps. 139:14; Ephesians 2:10). However, some of us may doubt that this is true, because we notice so many ways in which we fall short. Let’s look at some biblical examples of people who might have felt the same way.
Moses appeared to have many advantages while he was growing up in Pharaoh’s household. Then he killed an Egyptian and fled the country. No longer did he seem a likely candidate to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. But God looked beyond what Moses had done and saw who he could become.
Paul, prior to salvation, persecuted those who believed in Jesus. Yet through God’s mercy, the apostle became a mighty evangelist and author of almost half of the New Testament.
Peter denied—not once but three times—that he knew Jesus. Still, the Lord chose this simple fisherman to preach on the day of Pentecost.
God sees beyond our human frailties to the prospect of what we’re able to become in Him. Because His Spirit dwells in us, we have a greater capacity for spiritual transformation than we can imagine. Seek to become the person God has equipped you to be.
