Will you courageously trust God when He calls you to a task that feels beyond your abilities?
Most people would be honored to lead a nation. Perhaps Joshua felt that way, too. But there’s no doubt that he knew it would be a daunting task and responsibility. Yet he was determined to obey God no matter what.
The Hebrew people could be difficult. Not only did they grumble about food, water, safety, and rules; they also questioned Moses’ leadership and rebelled against God. Now Joshua—a man they once threatened to stone (Numbers 14:10)—was poised to lead them to their new home. It was a God-sized task indeed.
Ultimately, however, Joshua took up the mantle of leadership with courage, boldness, and resolve. He placed his faith in the Lord, who had never let the people down. Joshua fully expected God to be true to His word again and deliver them to the Promised Land.
No matter what challenge you are facing, God will enable you to tackle it bravely, calmly, and victoriously. Joshua’s courage was based upon years of seeing God’s faithfulness. Whether you’ve been a Christian for five minutes or 50 years, you can have the same confidence. The Bible promises that the Lord is sufficient to meet your needs and to keep your spirit secure all the way to heaven.
