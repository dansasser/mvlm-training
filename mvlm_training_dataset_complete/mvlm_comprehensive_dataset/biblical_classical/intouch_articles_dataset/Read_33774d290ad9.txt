Blessings of Obedience
Those who love the Lord want to please Him, so they choose to follow His leading.
In John 14:15, Jesus taught His disciples, “If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.” He repeated the connection between love and obedience several times because of its great importance. (See John 14:23; 1 John 5:3; 2 John 1:6.)
Following God’s will amounts to telling Him, “I love You.” Having the correct view of obedience—namely, that it’s an expression of love toward our heavenly Father—enables us to endure any difficulties we face. God pours out His blessings on those who obey Him.
Consider the example of Peter (also known as Simon). Jesus asked for use of his boat to preach to the crowd. Having been up all night without catching any fish, Peter might have given the Lord an excuse—too tired, too discouraged, a lot of cleaning up to do. Instead, he took a step into a life of obedience and blessing. On the surface, lending his vessel to help Jesus didn’t seem important beyond the moment. But God had more in mind than a one-time loan of a boat. He was going to use Peter’s life and make him a fisher of men (Matthew 4:19).
God rewarded Peter with service in His kingdom. He wants to do the same for us. How is the Spirit prompting you, and what is your response?
