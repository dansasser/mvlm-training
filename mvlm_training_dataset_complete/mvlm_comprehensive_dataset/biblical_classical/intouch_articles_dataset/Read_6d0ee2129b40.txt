We serve a lavishly generous God who gives us all we need—and more.
1 Corinthians 12:7-11
1 Corinthians 3:13-14
This Christmas, set aside some quiet time to reflect upon the divine gifts that forever changed the course of human destiny.
We generally focus on the Father’s gift: He gave His Son to be the Savior of the world (1 John 4:14). What we don’t often realize is that all three members of the Trinity have a part in this divine display of generosity, which continues into eternity. Jesus came to offer His life as a ransom for many (Mark 10:45). After His death and resurrection, He and the Father sent the Holy Spirit to live inside believers forever (John 14:16; John 16:7). The Spirit in turn gives spiritual gifts to all believers and produces His marvelous fruit in their lives (1 Corinthians 12:7-11).
These divine blessings don’t end on earth. They’ll continue in heaven, when the Lord judges Christians to grant rewards for good works they could never have accomplished apart from His strength (1 Corinthians 3:13-14; John 15:5).
We serve a caring, generous God. He needs nothing from His children but wants every part of us—not for the purpose of exerting authority but to continually shower us with His nonstop goodness. Consider the many gifts He’s freely given you and your loved ones, and ask yourself, How will I respond today?
