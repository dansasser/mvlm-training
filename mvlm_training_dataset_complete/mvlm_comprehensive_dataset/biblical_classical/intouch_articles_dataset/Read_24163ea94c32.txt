Obstacles to Contentment
Even those with a strong faith in the Lord may have seasons where they struggle with uncertainty.
When we place our faith in the Lord, we entrust every aspect of our life to our sovereign God, who wants the very best for His children. What do we have to fear when we place our confidence in Him?
Believing in the Lord doesn’t mean that we’ll never experience uncertainty. But it does mean we must choose to trust Him to provide for our needs in His time and His way. Otherwise, fear and doubt can manipulate our thoughts and compel us to make unwise choices.
Anxiety itself isn’t a sin, but faith can be shaken when its foundation is weakened by unbelief. For example, if we tell ourselves, I know God is capable of dealing with my problem, but I’m not sure He will, we may start to look for our own solution. Since it’s always wisest to wait on the Lord (Lamentations 3:19-25), trouble can brew when we take matters into our own hands.
The Lord sees the beginning and the end of every situation we face. He knows the causes of our anxiety, the best way to calm our heart, and how to turn our weeping into joy. When we leave the method and timing to Him, He will take care of the issue. And He’ll do so without leaving our side, because He loves us deeply and desires to bless us richly.
