To Be Filled With All God’s Fullness
We can understand God’s love because Jesus came to reveal it to us.
Paul ends his prayer for the Ephesians as he began, by praying for understanding. He asks God to help them “know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge” (3:19). This seems paradoxical at first glance. So how can we know something that surpasses knowledge? Why should we ask for something that, logically speaking, we can’t ever hope to possess? Remember that Paul doesn’t mean the kind of knowing that simply involves recalling a fact or repeating information we’ve memorized. He’s talking about the knowledge that comes from experiencing and practicing the love of Christ.
Consider this example. We love our kids and often tell them so. But if we ask our kids to define love, then they (like most of us) would be at a loss for words. Love surpasses our ability to define it. Yet our kids believe us when we say, “I love you.” Why? Because they know the truth in a place deeper than words; they feel it. Their knowledge about our love has been deepened and enriched by how they experience it in and through us.
And so we must pray that a knowledge of divine love would fill others with “all the fullness of God” (v. 19). Imagine His good news pressed into all corners of life, bringing transformation in every dimension. That would go far beyond any New Year’s resolution we could design for ourselves.
