No matter what is happening around us, we can rejoice in our Father's presence.
Are you happy? Your answer likely depends on what’s happening in your life right now. If things are going well, your health is good, and you have strong relationships, you may say, “Yes, I’m content.” The problem is that happiness is a fleeting emotion. When conditions change for the worse, it scurries out the door. But joy doesn’t.
Even though happiness and joy are often thought of as synonymous, they are actually quite different. Happiness is temporary because it’s based on our external circumstances, but joy can be a constant state—something that’s present no matter what’s going on in our life. That’s because joy is the result of God’s presence within us. It’s an internal condition that is unaffected by life’s difficulties.
David was able to say his heart was glad (Ps. 16:9) because he had discovered the key to walking in a constant state of joy, despite hardship. And we can do the same. By fixing our eyes on our Father (John 15:9-11), we can have peace and a glad heart no matter what. When we spend time with Him, experiencing His presence and goodness in our life, we will be able to walk through each day with His unsurpassable joy in our heart.
