There is always blessing for those who patiently seek God's direction.
Waiting on God is an important spiritual discipline in our walk of faith. King David’s life both teaches about the value of following the Lord’s plan and warns of the danger in moving ahead of Him.
When David was a shepherd, the prophet Samuel anointed him as Israel’s next king. Yet he did not become the ruler for many years. Waiting for the Lord to place him on the throne was made more difficult because the current king, Saul, turned against David and repeatedly tried to take his life. Despite the opportunity to take matters into his own hands, David held back (1 Samuel 24:1-7). He waited on God and was blessed for his obedience.
Years later, David made a decision without consulting the Lord. He chose not to join his troops in battle, even though that was one of his duties as a ruler (2 Samuel 11:1). During the time he stayed home, he noticed Bathsheba and coveted her. He conceived a child with her and then tried to cover up his sin. Instead of following God’s plan and being blessed, he experienced divine chastisement and heartache.
As believers, we want to obey the Lord, but there may be situations when we move forward without waiting for His direction. We must always be sure to seek God’s plan before we act.
