Present Yourself to God
We can fully trust the Lord because He is fully trustworthy.
Giving absolute power over our life to another human being would be an intimidating proposition. But that’s not true when it comes to the Lord. Unconditional surrender to Him is joyous. But to do so, we must ...
Yield ourselves to the lordship of Christ. One way of identifying with the Lord is by surrendering all that we have and all that we are. As we decrease, Jesus increases. And the first place surrender must occur is in our attitude. Then we live it out in obedient action.
Place no limit on what we’re willing to do or become. This means we have no restricted areas in our life where Jesus is not invited. Also, nothing is set aside for our exclusive use. We make ourselves totally available to God’s will.
Transfer ownership of our body, soul, and spirit to Christ. By doing so, we embrace the principles of the Beatitudes and the hierarchy of the kingdom (Matthew 5:3-12; Mark 9:35).
Relinquishing control of our life can feel scary, but when we put it fully in God’s hands, only good can result. What is keeping you from abandoning yourself to the Lord Jesus?
