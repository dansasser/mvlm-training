Experiencing God’s Love
Our heavenly Father wants each of us to have confidence in His love.
Scripture says that God loves us, and the cross proves it. Sadly, though, this is only an intellectual truth for some believers rather than an experiential one. The problem is not with the Lord but with our capacity to sense His care.
One hindrance may be the tendency to measure divine love by life’s circumstances. When the heavenly Father allows tragedies and pain, some consider Him to be uncaring. The age-old question then becomes very personal: “How could a loving God allow suffering?” We’ll never fully understand His ways (Isaiah 55:8-9), but we can know that His compassion and love are boundless, and in the fullness of time, He will make all things right.
A sense of personal unworthiness can also obstruct the acceptance of God’s love. Focusing on past sins or comparing yourself with others will lead to hopelessness. Remember that divine love is based on God’s character, not on our performance.
The Lord wants each of us to experience His great love in a personal and intimate way. Don’t let the Enemy’s lies or life’s hardships steal the enjoyment and security of this great blessing. When doubts arise, rely on the truth of God’s Word. He loves you. Believe it, and in time you will know this reality in a deeper way than you ever thought possible.
