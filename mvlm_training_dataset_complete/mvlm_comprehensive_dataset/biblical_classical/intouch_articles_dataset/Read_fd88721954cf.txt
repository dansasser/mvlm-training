Are you willing to follow God wherever He leads?
Three times in today’s passage, the apostle Paul uses the word called—once to describe himself as an apostle and twice to describe the believers in the church at Rome. In all three cases, he uses the same Greek term—klétos—which means “invited, called, or summoned by God.”
But what does it actually mean to be “called,” and is it something we can expect to happen today? The answer is yes, absolutely! God calls us, His children, in multiple ways and for multiple reasons. For instance, we are …
Called to Salvation—Sin created a barrier between us and God, so He reached out to establish a relationship with us by offering salvation through Christ (Ephesians 2:5-9).
Called to Sanctification—Once we have accepted Jesus as Savior, He calls us to strive for sanctification (or holiness). Our life’s goal is to be holy as He is holy (Leviticus 19:2; 1 Peter 1:16). What our Father expects is not immediate perfection but that we seek Him daily for guidance.
Called to Service—God has chosen to carry out His plans through those who are saved. Our task is to serve Him by walking “in a manner worthy of the calling with which [we] have been called” and accomplishing what He’s planned for us (Ephesians 4:1).
