Our heavenly Father rewards His children both now and forevermore.
1 Corinthians 9:24-27
Children aren’t the only ones who like to receive rewards. Adults are motivated by incentives too! And God’s Word makes exciting promises to those who walk in His way. Some of these benefits are available in this lifetime—like fulfillment, joy, and good favor—whereas other blessings will be bestowed once we are in heaven. As followers of Jesus, we need never fear judgment (Romans 8:1) because we are clothed in righteousness.
To help us understand divine rewards, the Bible describes several crowns. First, the crown of life is granted to believers who stand firm and endure trials (James 1:12). The second crown, called “imperishable,” is given to those whose great desire is to walk obediently before God (1 Corinthians 9:24-27). Next, the crown of righteousness is bestowed upon those who long for Christ’s appearing and live righteously through Him (2 Timothy 4:6-8). Lastly, God will give the crown of glory to those who share His Word with others (1 Peter 5:2-4).
The supreme reward is for us to manifest God’s glory throughout eternity. We will experience joy in His presence forever, but we don’t have to wait: We can begin today by serving Him obediently and humbly. Done with the right motive, service blesses us both now and in the future.
