Resurrected for the Present Work
By God's grace, we are a new creation—made for good works.
Romans 6:23 tells us that “the wages of sin is death.” In today’s passage, however, Paul tells the Ephesians (and us) that those wages are fully paid.
“You were dead in your offenses and sins,” the apostle writes (v. 1). We might not have realized it, but in reality, we were dead people walking. Thankfully, like the prodigal son’s father (whom we discussed a few days ago), God doesn’t let us remain that way.
Notice how Ephesians 2:4 begins: The two words “But God” should ring joyously in our ears. Our Father, full of mercy and love, “made us alive together with Christ” (v. 5). He raises people today just as He raised Jesus—only we rise from the walking death of sin to new and eternal life.
That reality shines a bright light on all we’ve experienced. In that light we see differently, finally realizing that sin always leads to death, not freedom. We can also act differently. When Jesus said the kingdom of God was at hand, He wasn’t offering information about our future but transformation for our present life. By grace through faith, we become God’s workmanship, walking not in death but in the life of good works He’s prepared for us.
