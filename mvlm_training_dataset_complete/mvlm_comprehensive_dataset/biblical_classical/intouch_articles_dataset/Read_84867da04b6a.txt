In the highs and lows of life, God is for us and promises to work everything for our good and His glory.
You’ve probably asked yourself, Is God really involved in the details of my life? If you’re like most of us, it’s easy to believe that God is in the good things. He’s surely in your successes, strong relationships, and good physical health. But you may wonder if He’s also in your failures, broken relationships, and sickness. Good news—He is!
Take note of an important distinction: God being in everything doesn’t mean that He is causing everything that happens to us. After all, we live in a fallen world full of brokenness and sin. There will always be trouble to deal with on this side of eternity. So, while God doesn’t create every circumstance we face, He does allow every circumstance. As He does, He’s weaving the good parts and the difficult parts of our lives together for our long-term benefit and His glory.
Nothing we’re dealing with has slipped by our sovereign God. Everything is under His control. When we choose to trust His ultimate goodness, we can both receive the joys of today with thanksgiving and accept the hardships with peace. It is the peace of knowing that God is with us, for us, and always working for the good of those who love Him.
