The Lord will provide all that’s needed for you to accomplish what He's called you to do.
Moses stood before Pharaoh and ordered him to release the Israelites from slavery. The confrontation must have seemed a ridiculous spectacle, even to the slaves Moses had been sent to rescue. But after 10 plagues, Moses was the faithful servant God used to bring a nation to its knees.
Choosing to walk by faith instead of living on the basis of feelings and logic often means being misunderstood. Our actions may appear unreasonable to the outside world, but what could be more reasonable than allowing our omnipotent heavenly Father to guide us? When we, like Moses, find our talents and abilities are no match for the task at hand, God’s power will accomplish through us what needs to be done (2 Corinthians 12:9).
Living by faith requires releasing our human sense of what is best and reasonable in order to rely wholly on God—it involves obeying when the Lord tells us that we are to speak or act. God wants us to trust that He has a plan for our life and is consistently directing circumstances and maneuvering people to ensure that His purpose is achieved.
Whatever the challenge, you can be successful by choosing to depend entirely upon the Father. He will help you overcome any challenges and make you victorious.
