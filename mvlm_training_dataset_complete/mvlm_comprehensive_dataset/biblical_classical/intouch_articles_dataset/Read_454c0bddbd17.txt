The Desires of Your Heart
True fulfillment is found when we delight in the Lord.
When people speak about their desires, they often cite Psalm 37:4 enthusiastically. We love the idea that the Father will give us what we desperately long for. But unfortunately, when we focus only on receiving good things, we miss the psalm’s context, which is a divine promise with human obligations.
God’s greatest interest is not to indulge us, but rather to give us more of Himself. Self-focused prayers overlook the first requirement for the promise’s fulfillment: delighting in the Lord. We are to take pleasure in time spent communing with and serving Him. As we read God’s Word and pray, we’ll experience His work in our life, and our faith in Him will deepen.
Over time, our growing trust means we’re beginning to learn God’s ways of thinking. He’ll remold our heart’s desires to match His (Ezekiel 36:25-27), but even so, what He provides may appear very different from what we request. Instead of giving us what we think we want, He bestows the perfect answer to our prayer.
God enjoys granting our requests, but His great joy is to hear us express a longing to know Him better. Receiving our heart’s desires is a byproduct of delighting in God and committing to His way. Our primary reward is a relationship with the loving God who offers to share Himself with humanity.
