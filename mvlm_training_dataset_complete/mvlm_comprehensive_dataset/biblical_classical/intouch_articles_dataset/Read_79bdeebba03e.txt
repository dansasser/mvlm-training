The Source of Our Identity
The God of all creation says you are chosen, precious, and called to live in His marvelous light.
How often do we evaluate ourselves based on our feelings instead of what God says? The problem is, our feelings are constantly changing.
Maybe today is one of those days—the car didn’t start, your boss has been breathing down your neck, the mortgage payment is due, and money is short. Remember, Satan will do whatever he can to divert your attention from the Lord. When we direct our focus toward circumstances instead of God, we can easily miss what He is telling us.
Take a look at what the Scriptures say about believers. Today’s passage calls us “a chosen people, a royal priesthood, [and] . . . God’s own possession.” And our purpose is to “proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called [us] out of darkness into His marvelous light.”
How encouraging it is to know that we’ve been called into God’s marvelous light. Yet unless we have help, we’re unable to escape the darkness of our troubles. When circumstances seem unbearable, remember that “you have been bought with a price” (1 Corinthians 6:20). Wake up each morning with the knowledge that you’re valuable to your Father. Trust in His Word, not your feelings. And allow the Holy Spirit to change your self-perception.
