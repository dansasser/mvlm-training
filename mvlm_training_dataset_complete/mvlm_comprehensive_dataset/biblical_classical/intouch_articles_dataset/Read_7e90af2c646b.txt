Abandoning the Self-Life
True freedom is found only by submitting to God.
Is there anything in your life that you’re unwilling to surrender to God? Keeping such things from the Lord might give us a sense of independence. But by following “self,” we interfere with God’s purpose for us. He wants every aspect of our life to be submitted to His will.
Jonah mistook rebellion for freedom. Today's passage paints a vivid picture of the prophet sweltering in the sun—and in the heat of his hatred. His blood boiled when God showed mercy to the Ninevites. “I have good reason to be angry, even to the point of death,” he ranted (v. 9). God had used him to save more than 120,000 souls, but Jonah was angry because he desired their destruction.
Freedom is not the same as autonomy. True freedom involves submitting to the Lord, which frees us from the yoke of sin and reconciles us to Him. Jonah obeyed with his body but not with his heart. He resisted the Lord’s every attempt to crack his pride. Believers have the right to choose self over submission, but the cost is high. Like the prophet, we may steep in emotional turmoil. Or God might deny us ministry opportunities. Whatever the consequences, one thing is certain: Autonomy will cause us to miss the blessing of intimacy with the Lord—and nothing is worth that.
