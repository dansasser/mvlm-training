Because God has an eternal perspective and is always good, we can trust Him through difficult seasons.
We all know people who’ve suffered from deteriorating health, financial reversals, and other troubles. How are we to view such situations in light of what the Bible teaches about the Lord’s goodness and His kindness towards us?
First, God’s character is perfect, and everything He does is right (Deuteronomy 32:4). He is “compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness” (Psalm 103:8). By His very nature, God is good. Second, the way our heavenly Father expresses His goodness is based on His purpose of conforming us to the image of Christ.
The greatest demonstration of God’s goodness is seen in His Son. Jesus left His heavenly home, took on the form of man, suffered, and died in our place so we might be forgiven (Philippians 2:6-8). Because of this, we who have trusted in Him are adopted into God’s family and promised an eternal home in heaven.
Our definition of the good life would probably include things that make us happy right now—like material success, good health, and the absence of difficulties. But God has an eternal perspective, and He always works to fulfill His long-term plan for us. We can trust in His goodness, even in dark times.
