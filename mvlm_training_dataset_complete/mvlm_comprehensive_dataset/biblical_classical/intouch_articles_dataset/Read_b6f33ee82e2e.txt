Adjusting to the Lord’s Plan
While following God may involve change or, at times, even loss, we can trust Him for a just reward.
Peter, Andrew, James, and John were fishermen before they became Jesus’ disciples. Their lives revolved around the details of their occupation—weather conditions, equipment repair, catching fish, and turning a profit. But in today’s passage, when Jesus called them to become fishers of men, they made a dramatic change (v. 22).
In contrast, the rich young ruler walked away sad when he realized what he’d have to give up to follow Christ (Matthew 19:21-22). An invitation from the Lord usually means modifying our way of living. Whether this involves switching jobs or altering habits, God expects us to adapt to His plan.
At times, the Lord may call for a shift in our relationships. Before being invited to travel in Jesus’ company, James and John had worked in the family business with their father. Saying yes to God meant seeing friends and relatives less frequently. But Christ promises a great return on any sacrifice we make (Matthew 19:29).
Our heavenly Father’s plans are based on His goodness, justice, and mercy. Because of His perfect character, we can trust the direction He gives us. Adjusting to God’s design—accepting His will and making needed changes in our circumstances and relationships—is always the wisest action to take (Proverbs 3:5-6).
