Trials reveal what we really believe and give us the opportunity to deepen our faith.
Yesterday, we saw that God wants us to focus on Him in times of trouble. As we do, we’ll discover that during our “storms,” He is doing important spiritual work in these three areas:
Beliefs. When circumstances are out of our control, what we truly believe comes to the fore—the depth of our faith in God’s character and promises will become evident, as will any doubts or uncertainties. For example, Joseph, after many trials, revealed strong belief by saying God’s intentions for the trouble were good (Gen. 50:20). Though at times we won’t succeed—like Peter, whose fear led to denying Christ (John 18:25-27)—we should think of adversity as an opportunity to deepen our faith and grow.
Transformation. As God’s children, we are to live in a way that displays Christ’s character. The heavenly Father can use challenging seasons to transform us into His Son’s image.
Comfort. Our Father brings us consolation and asks that we share with others the comfort we’ve received (2 Corinthians 1:3-4).
Difficulties can come from our own mistakes, schemes of the Enemy, or the hurtful actions of others. They can even be ordained by God. Regardless of the source, our Father works in them to benefit us and to bless others. How can you testify to His goodness in a hurting world?
