Our Source of Comfort
God sent His Spirit to live inside every believer, and He's always available to help us.
The world’s definition of comfort is the alleviation of suffering or despair. However, God has a different view: It’s a teaching tool. Because we mature spiritually when we exercise faith, our Father doesn’t remove our troubles but instead gives us the encouragement and strength to work through them.
God sent His Spirit to dwell within everyone who believes, and in that way, our source of help is as close as our own beating heart. When we face affliction and feel as if we can’t bear it, He whispers into our soul, “Yes, you can, because I am here.” There is no healing balm like the voice of God’s Spirit.
In some circumstances, the Spirit directs our mind to a Bible passage. Reading God’s Word is a way to hear directly from Him. A scripture’s personal meaning and application may not be apparent immediately, but God will bring the verse to mind at the time it’s most needed.
When we receive Christ, we are sealed as God’s child. The Lord promises us, “I will never desert you, nor will I ever abandon you” (Hebrews 13:5). He will walk beside us in every trial—and since He is omnipresent, He’s always available to help and comfort us.
