Through our choices, we have the privilege of revealing God's love to those around us.
As Jesus looked to the cross, His request was that He might glorify His Father (John 17:1). Though we aren’t called to such a great sacrifice, we should share in our Savior’s desire. From the moment we wake up each morning and as the day unfolds, our request should be, “Father, glorify Yourself.” In the simplest tasks as well as in the hardest ones, a Christian’s longing should be to reflect God to others.
When we pray for His glorification, we’re saying, “Lord, do whatever will bring You honor and make You known.” It means we are surrendering our preferences, acknowledging that God in His sovereignty will choose what will bring honor to His name.
There will always be some who reject the Son of God and refuse to believe in Him. But our desire should be the same as our Father’s—for people everywhere to know Him. God calls us to praise His name and reveal Him. The way we honor the Lord is by worshipping in our churches, testifying to His work in our life, and proclaiming the truth of His holy Word in our community.
Through our attitudes, actions, and words, we have the privilege of revealing our Father to a world that desperately needs Him. Let us join together, united in love, to give Him glory.
