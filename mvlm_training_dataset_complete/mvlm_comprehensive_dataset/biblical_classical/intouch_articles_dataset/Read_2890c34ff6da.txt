How God Answers Prayer
We can trust our heavenly Father to give the right answer at the right time.
Yesterday we read that Jesus promised our requests will be granted when we ask according to God’s will. But what you may not realize is that our Father waits for us to draw near with our big petitions. He delights in giving His children gifts just as parents do (Matthew 7:11). But we often find it hard to believe that He’ll keep His promises and will respond for our good.
We can be confident in God’s responses to what we pray “in Jesus’ name” because they will always align with His plan. We know the Lord will never act in a manner inconsistent with His character. So by searching the Scriptures, we’ll discover whether our desires line up with God’s nature and promises.
And in doing so, we might even find inspiration from someone with a dilemma similar to what we’re facing. For instance, Elijah was exhausted and in despair; Ruth and Naomi were poor widows in need of the Lord’s help; and David’s life was in danger. Seeing how others spoke to God about their difficulties can give us confidence to do the same—all while bolstering our faith.
God knows the perfect action to take and the right time to do so. But He invites us to ask in faith—and to keep on asking (Luke 11:9 NLT).
