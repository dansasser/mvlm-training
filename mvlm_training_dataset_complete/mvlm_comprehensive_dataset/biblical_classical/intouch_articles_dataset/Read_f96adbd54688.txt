Trusting God with our pain not only leads to joy and peace but also prevents our anger from spreading to others.
Anger can wreak havoc on our body and soul, but outbursts and resentment aren’t just our own personal issues. An angry spirit is contagious. It can be passed from one person to another—and from one generation to the next.
God created us to live in fellowship with others, but bitterness can taint our relationships—and those closest to us usually suffer the most. For instance, children learn to respond to life’s situations by observing their parents’ example. They then develop similar attitudes and patterns of behavior.
Thankfully, God is in the heart-changing business. Just as we learn an irate person’s ways by association, we can also learn righteous ways by walking closely with the Lord. Christ calls us to come, learn from Him, and find rest for our souls (Matthew 11:28-29).
Which would you prefer: bitterness or Christ’s peace? Both require sacrifice. To maintain anger, you might have to forfeit healthy relationships and a godly heritage for your loved ones. But to acquire peace, ask God to help you leave your grudges, personal rights, and insults on the altar. Then watch Him fill your heart with joy and peace.
