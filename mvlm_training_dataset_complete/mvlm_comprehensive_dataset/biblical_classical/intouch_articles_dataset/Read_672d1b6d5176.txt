No matter what’s happening in your life, you can refuse to worry—and trust God instead.
In today’s passage, the apostle Paul lists many of the good things believers gain when faced with tribulation—things like perseverance, character, and hope. The way these blessings stack atop one another in verses 3 and 4 make the passage very quotable and a delight to memorize. But we shouldn’t overlook what’s at the root of all these positive gains.
It can be found in verse one: “We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (emphasis added). The Greek word translated as “peace” is eiréné, a derivative of verb eirō, which means “to join, tie together into a whole.” When we said “yes” to the Lord’s generous offer of salvation, all the broken pieces of ourselves were put back together. All the gaps were filled. There is now nothing missing, nothing broken.
That absolute rightness, or peace, “surpasses all comprehension” (Philippians 4:7). When Jesus slept in the storm-tossed boat, He demonstrated what that looks like: safe and at rest, no matter what was going on around Him (Matthew 8:24-26). This is the peace we’re called to dwell in—and to extend to others who need it so desperately.
