The Secret of Contentment
We can experience peace and joy, no matter our circumstances, because of Christ in us.
2 Corinthians 11:23-26
After encountering Jesus on the road to Damascus, Paul had much to learn about salvation and following Christ. From that moment on, the apostle shared with others what he was discovering. In his letter to the church at Philippi, he wrote about an important life lesson—the secret of being content.
What do you think brings contentment? You might assume it’s a life with few troubles or great success. Perhaps you envision good health, financial security, and a loving family. Paul’s life was not at all like this. He was in danger from both his own countrymen and the opposition (2 Corinthians 11:23-26). Sometimes the people listened when he spoke, but more often they were hostile to his message. What’s more, Paul spent considerable time in prison, chained to a guard. Yet he boldly wrote, “I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation” (Phil. 4:12 NIV).
The secret he discovered was to live on the basis of his position in the Lord, not his circumstances. As God’s child, Paul knew he was spiritually rich—“blessed . . . with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ” (Ephesians 1:3)—because he had a loving Father and the Holy Spirit’s guidance. And so do we.
