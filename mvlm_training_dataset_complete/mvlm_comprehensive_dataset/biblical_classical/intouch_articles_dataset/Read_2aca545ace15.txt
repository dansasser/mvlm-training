The Lord is patient so that all people have an opportunity to repent.
God’s seemingly slow reaction to sin is often puzzling to believers. Today’s passage tells us why—the Lord is patient so that all people have an opportunity to repent (v. 9).
Jonah ran away from his duty to preach in Nineveh, because he expected that if the inhabitants atoned, his compassionate God would relent about destroying the city of the Israelites’ enemies. And that is precisely what came to pass. Instead of rejoicing in the Lord’s success, the prophet complained about His treating the Ninevites with grace and mercy (Jonah 4:1-2). Jonah was angry at God despite the fact that he had received such blessings himself.
More often than not, believers have ample reason to be thankful that the Lord, unlike human beings, is slow to anger (Psalm 145:8). When we are stubborn and unrepentant, He waits patiently for us to respond to conviction. Discipline is painful to both the recipient and the enforcer. God prefers that we see the error of our choices, stop thinking that we’re getting away with sin, and turn back to His righteous path.
The Lord places a high value on repentance and maintaining fellowship with Him. Do not wait for discipline. Instead, do what’s right, and turn your heart toward God.
