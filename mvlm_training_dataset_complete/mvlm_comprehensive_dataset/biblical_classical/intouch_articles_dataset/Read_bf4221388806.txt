The New Birth and Baptism
Baptism is a picture of the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ.
Jesus told His followers to go and make disciples, “baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit” (Matthew 28:19). As the early church spread the gospel message, it was often the case that baptism immediately followed a new believer’s response of faith.
Baptism is a powerful picture of salvation. This act is not only a proclamation of the good news that Jesus died on the cross for our sins, was buried, and rose again; it is also our testimony that we’ve welcomed His transforming power into our life.
The Greek word for “baptize” is the same term used to describe a cloth dipped in dye. It refers to total change, so by being plunged into the water, we declare that we’re choosing to die to our old way of life and unite with Christ: “We have been buried with Him” (Rom. 6:4). When we’re raised up out of the water, we affirm His resurrection. Baptism is a symbolic way of expressing that just as the Lord conquered death and rose again, we are spiritually resurrected from death into real life—born anew and transformed through the power of the Holy Spirit.
Faith shouldn’t be hidden like a light placed under a basket (Luke 11:33). When unbelieving family and friends look at our life, it’s important that they see how the gospel has changed us.
