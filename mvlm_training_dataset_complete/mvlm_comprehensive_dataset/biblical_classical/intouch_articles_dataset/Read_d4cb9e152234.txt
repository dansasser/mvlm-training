God designed you to serve a unique—and needed—role in His church.
1 Corinthians 12:12-13
1 Corinthians 12:12-13
Believers have two main responsibilities: to love God and to love people (Matthew 22:37-40). This is often done by serving. Where and how we serve varies based on our talents, skills, and calling, but we’re all expected to be involved with a local church.
When someone trusts in Jesus as Savior, that person is baptized by the Holy Spirit into the church—the body of believers living all over the world and united by faith. The biblical plan is that the new Christian will then choose, in accordance with God’s will, to join a local group of believers where he or she is loved and needed (1 Corinthians 12:18).
The church is more than a community. It’s a body with individual members created by God to function in communion with one another. Christians, like the world at large, are a diverse group of people, so we have to strive for unity. But our differences are something to be celebrated, with each person uniquely contributing to God’s purpose. A church truly operating as a unit—with all its varied gifts, talents, personalities, and intellects focused toward kingdom goals—is a thing of beauty in the Lord’s eyes.
The body of Christ functions most beautifully when all of its members resolve to serve God and each other to the best of their ability (1 Corinthians 12:25). How can you serve today?
