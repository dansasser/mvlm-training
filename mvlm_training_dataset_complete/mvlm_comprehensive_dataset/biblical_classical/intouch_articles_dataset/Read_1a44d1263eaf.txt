To live by faith rather than feelings, spend time meditating on God's Word.
We like to think that delays are no big deal. We tell ourselves, No one is really getting hurt by the things I put off. Over time, however, our choices can develop into an unhealthy pattern. In today’s reading, the ruler Felix delayed making a decision about Christ and eventually completely turned away from Him.
To get on track, we must change our attitude about hesitation, admitting the problem and noticing where we consistently put off action. Confessing that procrastination has a hold in our life is an important step, as is deciding to turn away from it.
We also should embrace living decisively. Use God’s Word to fight against feelings of doubt and discomfort. The Bible says that we are new creations, indwelt by God’s Spirit, and we are no longer slaves to sin (Galatians 5:1). Remember that Jesus, our Savior, is our Lord, and through His resurrection power, He provides everything we need. His grace turns our weakness into strength (2 Corinthians 12:9), and we have victory through Him (Romans 8:37).
When we order our life on the basis of Scripture, we will live by faith rather than feelings. Jesus offers to help us do away with hesitation and tentativeness. Don’t put off accepting His invitation!
