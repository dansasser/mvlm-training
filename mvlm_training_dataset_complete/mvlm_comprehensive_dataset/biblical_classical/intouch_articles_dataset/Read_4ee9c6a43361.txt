Job—A Reverent Father
What actions can you take to lead your family toward God?
When people talk about Job, the focus tends to be on how he remained loyal to God despite all his losses and pain. In fact, we often miss or gloss over the opening verses of the book, which describe what kind of father he was.
The New Living Translation says he was “a man of complete integrity” (v. 1). He showed great concern for the spiritual well-being of his 10 children. They took turns hosting celebrations at which they spent days feasting. But afterward Job would wake up early and offer burnt offerings for each child, just in case any of them had sinned. He had such reverence for God that he did all he could to make sure his beloved children had a right standing with the Lord.
This reverence didn’t waver, even when everything was taken from him. His unsupportive friends expressed doubts, and his wife even tempted him to curse God. But Job continued to honor his Creator and believed God would reign in the end (Job 19:25).
Living reverently before God day by day isn’t just the appropriate thing to do; doing so shapes our view of life and aligns our heart with His, no matter what comes our way.
