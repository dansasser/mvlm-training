No Exceptions to God’s Love
God has proven and repeatedly affirmed His great and eternal love for you—open your heart to receive it.
If you’ve been to church, then you’ve likely heard that God loves you and has a plan for your life. Do you believe that? Some, sadly, have decided verses like “For God so loved the world ...” (John 3:16) don’t apply to them. They think they’re too weak, sinful, or broken to merit the Lord’s love.
God thinks you are special. Because of the heavenly Father’s love for the world, He sent His Son to die on the cross as a sacrifice for the sins of everyone living in the past, present, or future. None of us deserve His care and protection, but thankfully, deserving isn’t the basis for His love. In fact, God’s very nature is love (1 John 4:8), which He demonstrated through Christ’s death “while we were yet sinners” (Rom. 5:8).
God cares so much for His children that He gives each one a unique place in His plan for the world. His followers are gifted with the specific abilities and attributes needed to carry out His individualized purpose for them in His kingdom (1 Corinthians 12:11).
The Lord loves you. He says so again and again in the Scriptures. That may be challenging to accept, especially if you’ve been mistreated by others—but don’t let those experiences detract from how He wants to bless you. Read His Word for yourself and see how deeply He cares for you, His beloved child.
