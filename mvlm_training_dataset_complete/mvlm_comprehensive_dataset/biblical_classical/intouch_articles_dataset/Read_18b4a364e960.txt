Through faith in Jesus, we can live forever in the presence of God.
People have different opinions about who goes to heaven. Some believe good behavior will bring automatic admittance. Others, while acknowledging they have bad habits and tendencies, hope traits like generosity or helpfulness will gain them entry.
However, Scripture tells us character and deeds do not determine our eternal state (Ephesians 2:8-9). Rather, it’s our sinful nature that forms a barrier between us and a holy God. As Romans 5:12 teaches, Adam and Eve’s sin caused all mankind to begin physical life dead in our sins. No amount of good works or moral behavior can change our unholy nature. Nor do bad choices make our nature worse.
Without direct help from God, we would be a people without hope—we’d find the entrance to heaven closed and would face everlasting separation from the Lord. But our loving Father sent His Son as our willing substitute: Jesus took our sins on Himself and received the punishment we deserved. What we were helpless to do, He accomplished for us. Through faith in the Savior, we have assurance that we will live in the presence of God forever.
Knowing we’re heaven bound gives hope and meaning to our life. Let’s tell others about Jesus, the source of our hope.
