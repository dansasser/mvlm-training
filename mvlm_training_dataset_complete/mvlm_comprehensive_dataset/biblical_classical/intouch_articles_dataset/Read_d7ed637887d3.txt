When believers love each other well, people are drawn to Christ.
Imagine yourself sitting on a park bench enjoying a gorgeous day. You see two people walking toward each other, and they’re both distracted. One is looking down at a phone, thumbs flying over the screen. The other is juggling keys, a briefcase, and a cup of coffee. Before you can say anything, they run into each other. No one is hurt, but things crash to the ground and spill everywhere.
There are many ways this scene could play out. Each person could get angry at the other for not paying attention, or they could accept blame and apologize. They might even ignore each other and keep walking (though that’s highly unlikely). How they choose to react reveals what their character is—and has the potential to color onlookers’ opinions of them, for better or worse.
This is especially important with regard to those of us who follow Christ. Our behavior should reflect who we are becoming in Him and demonstrate that we are indeed transformed people. If we lash out in anger or frustration, we aren’t following Paul’s call to “be kind to one another, compassionate, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven [us]” (Eph. 4:32).  However, if we choose the way of peace, kindness, and compassion, others will see the Lord through us and be drawn to His light (Hebrews 12:14).
