Intimacy With Our Heavenly Father
Are you enjoying the privilege of a close relationship with your heavenly Father?
From the very beginning, God intended to have an intimate, loving relationship with His children. How do we know this?
His Son. Jesus, who is the exact representation of the Father, came to earth so we would know God. Their words and works were the same (John 5:19; John 12:50).
Invitation. Through Scripture, God invites us to join His family. He has taken care of the arrangements (John 3:16).
Adoption. At salvation, we are adopted into the Lord’s family. This relationship with our heavenly Father lasts for an eternity and provides us with support, encouragement, and love.
Friendship. By calling His disciples “friends” (John 15:15), Jesus revealed a new aspect to their relationship. Jesus is a forever friend—one who will never desert us or turn away.
His Presence. From the moment of our salvation, we are indwelt by the Holy Spirit.
The heavenly Father invites us to join His family through faith in Jesus Christ. This is our highest calling—to believe in the Savior and live for Him all of our days (John 20:31). Once we become God’s children, His Spirit will work in us to make our family resemblance stronger and clearer in thought, word, and deed.
