Advent: A Time of Anticipation
Are you ready for Christ’s return?
This month, many of us rush from appointment to appointment as we shop, cook, and attend concerts, special church services, and other gatherings. Some of us look forward to the time with loved ones and the busyness of the Christmas season, while others of us breathe a sigh of relief when it’s all over.
This time of year, we encounter many well-intentioned articles and programs encouraging us to slow down and simplify. That can be good counsel. Considering what isn’t essential in a packed December schedule can be a clarifying exercise. But it might be helpful to add another question to the conversation: As we prepare for Christmas, who is it we’re waiting for?
The final chapters of Revelation are a reminder about the One who is coming. The wait of Advent can point us toward this reality and motivate a year-round mindset of readying ourselves for a lasting, eternal celebration with our Lord. Worshipping our coming King, obeying Him, serving Him, and always seeking to be faithful in things large and small—that’s the kind of preparation we can make, not just at this season but every day of our life.
