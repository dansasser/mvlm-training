Ongoing anger robs you of the life that God desires for you, so ask the Lord for help to overcome it.
Anger can shut down communication and destroy relationships. Unchecked, it can boil over and hurt others.
While we can think of many reasons to justify our anger, the only viewpoint that matters is the Lord’s. The book of Proverbs offers insight into how God views angry people. He says they act foolishly (Proverbs 14:17), stir up strife (Proverbs 15:18), and commit transgressions (Proverbs 29:22). He also warns us not to associate with such individuals (Proverbs 22:24).
In contrast, those who are slow to anger have great understanding (Proverbs 14:29) and demonstrate wisdom (Proverbs 29:8). Keeping one’s distance from strife also shows honor (Proverbs 20:3).
The apostle James compared the tongue to a spark that can set a forest on fire (James 3:5-6). He also taught that our anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires for us, nor does it fit who we are in Christ.
There were a few instances when Jesus became angry, but they were fully in line with the Father’s purposes and were therefore righteous. In us, however, anger is usually born out of self-defense, hurt feelings, or thwarted desires. If the Lord has convicted you of anger, confess that sin and allow the Spirit to reproduce Christlike character in you.
