Be patient—God's timing is always perfect.
Throughout the Bible, we see God at work in people’s lives. Sometimes He acts in dramatic ways, as with the parting of the Red Sea. At other times it may appear as if He’s not taking any action. For example, Mary and Martha sent word that their brother was dying, but Jesus delayed coming to them (John 11:3-6).
Our Father has given us the Holy Spirit to help us recognize His presence and handiwork. The Spirit cultivates discernment in us so we can understand when and where He’s at work. We must also develop patience because God operates according to His timetable, not ours. After being promised numerous descendants, Abraham had to wait years before Sarah conceived, by which time they were both very old.
The Lord’s efforts can bring delight, as was the case when Hannah bore a child (1 Samuel 1:27-28; 1 Samuel 2:1). His plan can also lead through painful times, which was Joseph’s experience. Before the Lord elevated him to a position of authority, Joseph was sold into slavery and unjustly imprisoned.
We will be encouraged and strengthened in our faith when we recognize how the Lord is operating in and around us. These glimpses of His handiwork will motivate us to stay the course and help us maintain a godly perspective on life.
