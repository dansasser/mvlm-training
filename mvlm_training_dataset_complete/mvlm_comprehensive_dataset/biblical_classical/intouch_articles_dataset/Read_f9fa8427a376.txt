Praising God lifts our eyes from our problems to the certainty of our heavenly Father's care.
God has made us a special people so that we may fulfill a special purpose. Isaiah 43:21 says, “The people whom I formed for Myself will declare My praise.” An integral part of worshipping the Lord is proclaiming His greatness.
To praise our Father is to applaud Him for who He is and what He has done. When we love another person, it is natural to speak highly about him or her. In the same way, those who love Christ find that praise for Him comes easily.
Praising the Lord is good for us. It’s easy to become focused on getting our own needs met. And sadly, this attitude has infiltrated some churches. But God doesn’t want us to come to church concerned only about ourselves. Praise lifts our eyes to Jesus and fills our heart with the contentment that eludes us when we focus exclusively on our own needs and problems.
Praise and worship are usually associated with church services, but they should characterize us wherever we are. Some of the most intimate and precious experiences of worship can happen when we’re alone with the Father.
Remember how God has cared for you, and look for daily evidence of His hand on your life. Then tell the Lord you want to learn to extol Him with your whole heart.
