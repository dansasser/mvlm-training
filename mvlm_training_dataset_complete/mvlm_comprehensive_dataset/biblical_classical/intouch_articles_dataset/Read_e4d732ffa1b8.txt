Baptism: Identifying With Christ
Baptism demonstrates our connection with the Lord and other believers.
Christ began His public ministry with baptism. At the time, John the Baptist was calling people to confess sin and demonstrate repentance through immersion in the river. So why did Jesus, the sinless One, ask to be baptized?
At first, John actually refused, knowing that Jesus was the “Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world” (John 1:29). But Jesus told him to allow it; He was sacrificially identifying with us and demonstrating full obedience to God.
As Christians, we’re called to follow His example, becoming more like Him. That’s why baptism is so important in following Jesus. He was willing to identify Himself with us, and we likewise publicly align with Him when we are baptized. It is a symbolic way of declaring, “I have trusted Jesus as my Savior, and I believe that He died on the cross and rose again. I will show my love for Him by following His example for the rest of my days. I will walk in the Lord’s will and spend eternity with Him.”
Baptism demonstrates our connection not only with the Lord but also with our spiritual brothers and sisters—past, present, and future. Joining everyone who has walked before us in faith, we are saying that we’re members of one body, redeemed and given new life by the same Lord.
