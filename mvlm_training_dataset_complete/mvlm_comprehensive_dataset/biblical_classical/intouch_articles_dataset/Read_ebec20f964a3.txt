Prayer: Our Time Saver
When we take time to seek Christ's wisdom, He'll accomplish more through us than we can do by ourselves.
What’s the first thing you think about when you wake up? Are your thoughts instantly focused on the day ahead, or are they centered on the Lord? The most important and time-saving part of each day is that which is spent with our heavenly Father.
Yet many of us feel so rushed that we don’t think there’s enough time for God. We immediately begin our day but then wonder why we’re so confused and dissatisfied. Even if our desire is to follow God, we don’t know where He’s leading, since we never stopped to get directions for the day (Ps. 143:8). Without daily communication, no one can have intimacy with Christ.
Perhaps the problem is human logic. We think time spent reading and praying will result in having less time and lower productivity. However, when we stop to seek Christ’s direction and wisdom, He’ll accomplish more through us than we can do by ourselves. He will give us wisdom for good decisions, increase our strength and energy, and free us from time-wasting anxiety (Philippians 4:6).
Ask yourself, Am I too busy for the Lord? If the answer is yes, then you’re denying yourself the blessing of an intimate relationship with Christ. When you make time for Him, He’ll fill you with peace and joy, guide you, grant you wisdom, empower you to obey, make you more productive, and comfort you with His love.
