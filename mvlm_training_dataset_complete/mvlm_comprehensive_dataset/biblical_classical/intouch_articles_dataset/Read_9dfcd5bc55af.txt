Defeating Our Goliaths
Faith habits prepare us for the inevitable battles that come.
Life’s “Goliaths” come in all shapes, sizes, and intensities: an unhappy relationship, a difficult job, a pile of debt. In today’s passage, David faced what appeared to be an insurmountable problem, but he was victorious through God’s power. We can be, too.
David declared victory over Goliath before the battle even began (v. 46). His confidence was rooted in his past experiences with the Lord. What’s more, David believed triumph was certain because he came in the name of the Lord. As a shepherd, he’d spent hours alone in the wilderness, listening to God’s voice. Even a giant’s discouraging shout couldn’t shake his convictions about who God was and what He could do through His servant.
David had practical faith habits. A strong relationship with the Lord developed from spending time in His presence. This in turn enabled David to face problems with certainty that he was a beloved child of God, with full access to his Father’s storehouses of power, courage, and wisdom. If doubts ever arose, he could look back on God’s great faithfulness in past troubles.
To be victorious, we should practice David’s spiritual habits. Spend time with God and keep a record of His work in your life. Then you can be confident that He is sufficient, no matter the obstacle.
