Judgment for Believers
In Christ, we receive not only the blessed assurance of heaven but also opportunities to honor Him now.
As believers in Jesus Christ, we are assured of our salvation. We need not fear eternity, because we know that we will dwell with the heavenly Father forever in paradise. What blessed assurance!
But salvation is about more than simply getting into heaven. It’s about the process of becoming increasingly like Jesus while we’re living on earth. In fact, we will someday be asked to account for the way we used our opportunities, abilities, and resources here.
In His parable of the talents (Matthew 25:14-30), Jesus shared the importance of wisely investing all that our Father has bestowed on us. God gives His children different types and amounts of wealth, gifts, blessings, and talents. What matters to the Lord is the way we make use of them, not how much we have. Do we take what He has given and selfishly utilize it all for our own good and protection? Or do we generously and cheerfully use those gifts and skills to serve the Lord?
Stop to consider your blessings. How do you utilize all that the heavenly Father has bestowed upon you? Each one of us must choose how we are going to live. It is our responsibility to be faithful servants of the living God, doing whatever He calls us to do.
