Saying Yes (When We Want to Say No)
We don't have to worry about what happens if we obey God—He will take care of us.
Jonah 3:1-10; Jonah 4:1-11
In a fish’s belly, Jonah recommitted himself to the Lord’s purpose. But the popular Bible story about the consequences of disobedience doesn’t end with Jonah obeying God. The book actually concludes with him acknowledging why he didn’t want the job—and with the Lord chastising him for his selfish reasons.
Jonah was afraid that the Ninevites—who were a threat to the Jews—might actually repent, and God wouldn’t destroy them. Jonah admitted he wanted to see them wiped out: “Therefore in anticipation of [their salvation] I fled to Tarshish” (Jonah 4:2).
Believers resist doing God’s will for many reasons. Sometimes we say no because we dislike the probable outcome of obedience. Like Jonah, we also can lose sight of spiritually important things and focus on our own desires. But if the Lord calls us to act, He will take care of the end results. Our job is to obey.
What form of selfishness might be keeping you from obeying the Lord? Maybe you are too angry with your spouse to work on your marriage or too hurt to welcome back a repentant child. But we’re not to be ruled by feelings, no matter how strong they are. The heavenly Father calls us to obey Him. The final results may surprise you, particularly how blessed you will be for having followed Him.
