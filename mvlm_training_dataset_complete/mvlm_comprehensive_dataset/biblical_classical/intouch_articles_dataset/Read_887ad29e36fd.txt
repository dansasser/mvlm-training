The Power of Corporate Prayer
Are you willing to join others in praying for solutions to problems?
2 Chronicles 20:14-30
2 Chronicles 20:14-30
When trouble loomed, Jehoshaphat turned his attention to God and proclaimed a fast throughout Judah (2 Chronicles 20:3) People came from all around to support their king in prayer (2 Chronicles 20:13).
The body of Christ depends upon cooperation. One of the wisest things we can do in the midst of difficulty is to engage the assistance of those who are faithful in praying. Jehoshaphat understood this. Though he was a king, he recognized his limitations and sought divine intervention through prayer.
When the people of Judah prayed, God provided a solution through a trusted prophet. Jehoshaphat was humble enough to listen and wise enough to follow the Lord’s directives (2 Chron. 20:14-17). As a result, the people were saved. The advancing armies turned against each other and destroyed themselves completely, while Judah’s forces suffered not even one casualty. Because their humble king listened, they were able to witness the supernatural victory (2 Chron. 20:22-30).
We have to attune our ears to God’s voice in order to hear Him. Sometimes He may speak through people we wouldn’t ordinarily choose to follow; He may even say things we’re not expecting to hear. But the Lord will provide us with solutions to our problems if we are willing to bring them to Him.
