Everything we need is found in Christ, who freely gives with mercy and compassion.
Yesterday, we learned that Christ is the foundation for our faith, and that’s a comforting truth. Let’s explore the Lord’s actions to learn more about His nature. Jesus ...
• Forgave others. The Lord showed mercy to those who recognized their sin. For example, He had compassion on the woman caught in adultery, and instead of pronouncing condemnation, He said that her sins were forgiven (John 8:1-11).
• Comforted the hurting. He visited Mary and Martha, who were mourning the loss of their brother (John 11:1-45).
• Provided for needs. After spending three days healing, He was concerned that the large crowd hadn’t eaten, and He provided more than enough to satisfy their hunger (Matthew 15:30-37).
•Interceded for His disciples. Just before He was crucified, Jesus asked the Father to protect and sanctify His followers, which includes believers today (John 17:15-20).
• Strengthened believers. In Acts 1:8, the Lord sent His disciples out to share the gospel, assuring them, “You will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you.”
Jesus still forgives, comforts, provides, intercedes, and empowers today. Praise God for the refuge He has provided in our Savior.
