The School of Obedience
We can fully trust and obey God because He will never fail us.
Obedience is a funny thing. We expect it from our children, and it’s essential to success in organizations like the military. However, if we’re being honest, none of us truly enjoys surrendering our will to another person. They can fail us, after all. Thankfully, God never does, and obeying Him is always the wisest course of action.
Learning to obey involves ...
Trusting. Obedience comes from a foundation of faith, while most rebellion stems from a lack of it. That means we will believe God is who He says He is—and accept His plans, methods, and timing. We show our love for the Father by living this way (John 14:15). And remember, God delights in blessing those who follow His will.
Waiting. When we don’t know what to do, we often try to rely on our own understanding, make a move, and then hope God will bless it. That’s not scriptural. God’s given us His Spirit as our teacher because He wants us to know His mind and intentions for our life. We must wait in an attitude of trust until we are certain.
God assumes full responsibility for giving us direction in our life. He desires to reveal each step along the way. But we must come to Him with a trusting heart and a willingness to wait before He reveals the next step.
