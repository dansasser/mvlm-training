The Power of an Ordinary Person
The only prerequisite for serving the Lord is a willing heart.
Peter was an ordinary man who lived in an extraordinary time. His was the generation that saw Jesus live, die, and rise again.
Peter’s brother Andrew first brought Peter to meet the Lord (John 1:40-42). When Jesus invited them to become disciples, both brothers left their fishing trade to follow Him (Matt. 4:20).
Peter became a passionate follower who demonstrated an eagerness to be near Jesus. Whether encountering Christ on the water during a storm (Matthew 14:27-29) or speaking to Him during His transfiguration (Matthew 17:1-5), Peter was devoted to his Master’s service.
In the beginning, Peter was quick to speak and act, and this impulsiveness created problems for him. For example, when Jesus was talking about His imminent suffering and death, Peter objected, as if he knew better than the Lord. Christ’s rebuke was swift and direct (Matthew 16:21-23). The apostle learned from his mistakes and was later given great responsibility. He’s a good example of how we should release personal desires, wholeheartedly embrace Jesus’ way, and walk closely with Him (Mark 8:34).
The Lord chooses ordinary people like Peter to build His kingdom. He asks His followers to love Him above all else and fully commit to obeying Him. When we do, He will accomplish more through us than we could ever imagine.
