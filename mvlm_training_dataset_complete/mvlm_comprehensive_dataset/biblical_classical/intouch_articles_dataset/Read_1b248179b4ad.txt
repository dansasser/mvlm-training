The Attributes of God
The eternal, unchangeable God gives us the privilege of knowing Him personally.
As believers, we desire to know the One we worship. Though our comprehension is limited, understanding all we can helps to deepen our relationship with the Lord and also to share our faith. So let’s explore four attributes of Almighty God. He is ...
A “person” (Exodus 20:1-6). God created us with the ability to feel, reason, and make decisions, and we were made in His image (Genesis 1:26). That means He also has the capacity for emotion. And in fact, the Bible frequently mentions God’s feelings, like anger and love.
Spirit (John 4:22-24). He has no limitations; He isn’t confined to a body or place, so we can worship in His presence anywhere. His Spirit indwells each believer (Romans 8:9), so we can enjoy His companionship and guidance anytime.
Eternal (Isaiah 40:28). He always was, is now, and forever will be. Nothing existed before Him or will outlast Him.
Unchangeable (Malachi 3:6). His nature and attributes always remain constant.
What a blessing that God would reveal His character to us. And how amazing that He makes it possible for us to have a relationship with Him through Jesus. May we praise Him and continue seeking to know Him better through His Word.
