The Protective Power of Discernment
Believers who make prayer and Bible study a regular part of their routine are more likely to be attuned to God's voice.
Spiritual discernment protects us from deception. Sin is often dressed up to look tempting and appealing. But if we think what looks good and feels right must be okay, we’re in danger of being misled by the enemy.
Spiritual discernment is our God-given capacity to judge what’s right and wrong. Ignoring an agitation in our spirit—or spiritual “static”—is a step onto a bad and harmful path. We need a clear connection to the Holy Spirit to have assurance that our choices are aligned with God’s will.
Sometimes an opportunity appears harmless or, more likely, very appealing. But if the Holy Spirit within us sends a signal not to pursue it, then we shouldn’t—for some reason, God doesn’t want us in that situation. And though we can speculate, we may never know what danger we avoided by being obedient.
Sin often comes wrapped in a pretty package, but God’s children can see past the glitter and false beauty if they choose to look with scriptural wisdom. This comes only from a clean heart and discerning spirit (Colossians 1:9-14). An astute believer is one who makes prayer, repentance, and biblical training a regular part of his or her routine.
