Painful disagreements are a part of living in this world—how we respond matters.
The Scriptures record many instances of conflict—between nations, among friends, and in families—and we see the same things today. While fighting, people can say harsh, unfair words. Their accusations often create turmoil and emotional pain. But the way we respond to such aggressiveness is determined by what we believe.
To start with, we should remind ourselves of two things. First, God has the power to work our painful times into something beneficial. And second, our caring heavenly Father always remains by our side. He understands what we’re experiencing and will walk with us through it.
God’s Word proclaims His sovereignty over nature (Psalm 135:6), government (Job 12:23), and mankind (Acts 17:25). When we believe in His sovereign rule, our perspective on hard times changes. Then, instead of responding with fear or resentment, we will turn to Him in prayer and ask for guidance.
In the world, conflict is inevitable. When something we’ve done is the source of the turmoil, we should apologize. If others are at fault, we should forgive. As Christ’s ambassadors, the way we respond really matters.
