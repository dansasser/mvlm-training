God's love for us is rooted in who He is—not in who we are.
1 Corinthians 13:12-13
1 Corinthians 13:12-13
Love is a powerful emotion, one that can motivate us to give more generously, live more selflessly, and care more deeply than we ever thought possible. Loving another person is something we experience in our body, mind, and soul—often in ways that defy simple explanations. But how is it possible to know if we love God, whom we cannot see, hear, or touch?
Jesus’ love for the Father was demonstrated through perfect obedience. Every word, thought, and deed—from the time He left heaven to be born as a baby in Bethlehem until His ascension—was done according to God’s will. Their relationship was so intimate that Jesus not only knew exactly what His Father desired but also delighted in obeying Him. (See Psalms 40:7-8; John 6:38.)
If we want to grow in our love for the Lord, we must draw near to Him, study His Word, and spend time in prayer, actively listening for His voice. And then, like Jesus, we must live out what we learn.
On this fourth Sunday of Advent, as we prepare to celebrate the birth of our Savior, consider His great love for you—a reality strong enough to compel Him to die in your place. God wants nothing more than to pour out His boundless love upon humanity. We just need to be open to receive it.
