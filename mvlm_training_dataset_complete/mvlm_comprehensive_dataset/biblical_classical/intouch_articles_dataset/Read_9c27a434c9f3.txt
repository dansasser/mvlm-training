Faith grows through hardship—if we choose to believe that God is always working for our good.
In today’s reading, Paul writes, “We are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head” (Eph. 4:15). As believers, we should constantly strive to grow closer to God. When He is the Lord of our life, certain characteristics will be evident. Here are two spiritual benchmarks to help us evaluate our progress:
We know we’re growing spiritually when we become increasingly aware of our sinfulness and respond with quick repentance. Failure to deal with sin is rebellion against God. Growing believers turn away from wrongdoing and embrace righteousness. As we live a life of dependence and repentance, our desire to obey God intensifies and the attraction of sin diminishes.
Spiritual growth is also marked by an increase in two things—joy and struggle. Faith is often developed through hardship; in fact, we will more easily grasp how they are connected when we practice living with trust and endurance. So our relationship with the Lord will deepen when we view trials and temptations as opportunities for us to mature (James 1:2-4).
The sovereign God is the gatekeeper of our life. We are maturing when we perceive whatever comes our way as being allowed by our Father and realize He’s working every situation for good.
