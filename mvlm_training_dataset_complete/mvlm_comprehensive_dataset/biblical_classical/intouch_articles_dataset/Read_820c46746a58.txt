Christians in the Workplace
Can your coworkers see evidence of Jesus in you?
How people view the gospel is greatly affected by Christians who act differently at church than they do elsewhere. The way we live should permeate all areas of life—even the workplace.
Our behavior reflects our faith. So if we claim to be a Christian, then our coworkers, bosses, and employees will equate our attitudes and actions with Jesus. Do those around you at the office see a positive reflection of God in your labors?
Let’s look at a scriptural model. For one thing, as we read in today’s passage, we should view ourselves as servants and put others’ needs before our own. Next, we must realize our true boss is Christ; therefore, we work with integrity and effort, knowing that our reward is from Him (Colossians 3:23). Then, since all authority on earth is God-given (Romans 13:1), we should obey our superiors gladly—unless, of course, our human boss tells us to do something that goes against Scripture. And finally, we’re to see that all those we work with and for have worth in the Creator’s eyes and should be treated with respect (1 John 4:7-8).
Even when tasks or coworkers are difficult, we are to work as if God is our boss. That means doing tasks with joy, a servant’s attitude, respect for others, and diligence. Imagine what the workplace could be if all believers approached their jobs this way.
