David: A Picture of Servanthood
God will work through any person whose heart is submitted to Him.
Throughout his life, David served God in multiple capacities. The biblical account shows how his devotion in various roles allowed him to be used mightily by the Lord:
Shepherd. David was anointed king long before he took the throne (1 Samuel 16:1-13). During his days of waiting, he learned to be strong and brave, and to take care of those weaker than himself. An early life of obedience to his human father taught him the humility he would need later to depend on God.
Psalmist. David’s writings reveal his hunger for the Lord. He is open about his fear, depression, defeat, loneliness, and sorrow. By describing valley experiences and communing with the Father in the night watches, David provides us with intimate glimpses of the God he knew so well.
Commander. He ruled Israel for 40 years, and his people called Jerusalem the “City of David.”
His life also teaches us about the consequences of sin and the limitlessness of God’s grace. King David served God’s purpose not only when he lived but also ever since: Through writings by and about him, countless believers have been blessed by David’s obedience, service, and talents. He is a great example of what God can accomplish through those who yield their life to Him.
