Strength Comes With Waiting
Access to God's power is achieved not by moving faster but by going slower.
Exhaustion is a by-product of overcommitted schedules and endless responsibilities. That’s not what our Father wants for us. He offers a radically different mode of living and gives His followers renewed strength.
Those who wait on the Lord are promised His supernatural energy. In fact, Scripture says it will surpass the natural strength and endurance of the young (Isa. 40:29-30). Contrary to what we might think, access to this power is achieved not by moving faster but by going slower—taking the time to focus on God, seek His direction, and ask for His strength to accomplish what He’s calling us to do. There is no earthly explanation for what God is willing and able to achieve in and through a yielded human being. His Holy Spirit is like a powerful and refreshing gust of wind that enables us to soar like eagles (Psalm 103:5).
The next time you are at the point of exhaustion, take some time to focus on the Lord. Are you in step with Him, or have you gone ahead on your own? Align your pace with His, taking the time to rest when He wants you to, and receive the energy He freely offers to those who walk obediently in His will.
