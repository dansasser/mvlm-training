Good News of Great Joy
Through Jesus, we receive eternal life—and divine joy.
When an angel of the Lord appeared to the shepherds, he gave them good news of great joy for all people: The long-awaited Savior was born! Then the angel was suddenly “joined by a vast host of others—the armies of heaven—praising God” (Luke 2:13 NLT).
The good news they proclaimed that day had to do with more than just Jesus’ birth. It anticipated His sinless life, which qualified Him to be God’s sacrificial lamb. It looked ahead to His crucifixion and resurrection, which signaled the Father’s acceptance of Christ’s payment for our sins. It also encompassed His future ascension into heaven (Mark 16:19). And it envisioned Pentecost, when the Spirit would indwell believers (Joel 2:28; Acts 2:17), as well as the time Jesus would return as King. The angels rejoiced because salvation was here (2 Corinthians 6:2).
Jesus spoke about joy because He wanted us to experience the satisfaction that comes from a relationship with Him. Such profound contentment isn’t dependent upon outward circumstances; rather, it is the fruit of the Holy Spirit in you.
The angels in heaven rejoiced at the announcement of Jesus’ birth, and the shepherds praised God. Are you experiencing the divine joy that overflows from a Spirit-filled life?
