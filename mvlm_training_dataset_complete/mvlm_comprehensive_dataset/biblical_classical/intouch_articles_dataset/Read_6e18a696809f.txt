Sunday Check-In With Dr. Stanley: A Tale of Two Seeds
Don't let a desire for comfort cause you to miss all God wants to do through you in the world.
There were two kernels of wheat lying on the floor of a cozy barn. One day the farmer came in and told them, “I want to take you out of the barn and plant you in the earth. I’m going to put you in the ground and cover you with soil. It’ll be dark, and you’ll die. But I promise that you will multiply and become fruitful.”
The first kernel of wheat said, “No way! Count me out. I like my comfort, and I don’t want to die.” But the second one, after careful consideration, decided the promise of a future harvest was worth the sacrifice. So the farmer took him outside and planted him but left the first kernel of wheat in the barn.
A few days later, a small green sprout appeared where the seed had been planted. It grew and became a stalk of wheat that produced a hundred more kernels. For the next 40 years, the farmer planted all the seeds that had originated from that first one, and year after year the harvest multiplied. However, the kernel that stayed in the barn remained there by itself, never multiplying.
Which kernel of wheat are you? Are you playing it safe, or have you let Christ plant you in the world? The best way to influence God’s kingdom is to let go of your own desires, get out of your comfort zone, and serve the Lord by serving others.
