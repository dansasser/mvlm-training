Pass Down Your Example
Our actions really do speak louder than our words.
Yesterday, we looked at one way you can pass your faith down to future generations. Today, let’s look at the second: by your lifestyle. You’ve no doubt heard the popular saying “Actions speak louder than words.” It’s important to tell others about Jesus, but we need to show His love through our actions, too.
Today’s verse is from the Sermon on the Mount. In it, Jesus is describing the righteousness that should characterize His followers, but it’s not what they’ve been taught by the religious leaders. In fact, most of the sermon focuses on actions—loving enemies, being merciful, and reconciling with those we’ve wronged. In verse 16, Jesus says, “Your light must shine before people in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.”
So, what can we pass down to our loved ones? We can give them a day-by-day, year-by-year example of faith. We can teach them how to love Jesus and others well by imitating what they have seen in us. We can show them how to respond to a difficult situation in a Christlike way. And most importantly, we can come before our heavenly Father to intercede on their behalf.
