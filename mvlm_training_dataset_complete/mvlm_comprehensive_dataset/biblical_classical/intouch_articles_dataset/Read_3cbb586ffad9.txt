The Privilege of Knowing God
Nothing else brings the joy and contentment we find in a personal relationship with God.
Regardless of how many people we meet or how many wonderful things we do in our lifetime, the greatest privilege of all is to know God. Nothing else can bring the joy and contentment we yearn for. And yet we frequently chase after worldly acceptance because we forget the treasure of truly knowing the living God.
Oftentimes people say a salvation prayer and remain satisfied with this first step. If they’re asked, “Do you know God?” most will say they do. But there’s a vast difference between knowing facts about God and personally relating to Him. Believers should continually be growing closer to the Father—always learning more about who He is and what He considers important.
When people go through life depending on themselves, they never really know God—He will reveal Himself to a heart that is honest and transparent, not one that’s full of pride and arrogance. It is in our brokenness and helplessness that we discover who the Lord is.
Do you have a genuine hunger in your heart to know God? If so, ask Him, “Who are You? What are You like?” Then open yourself to God, not for His sake—He already knows you perfectly—but for your own sake (John 17:3). By spending time with your Father, you’ll discover you are privileged indeed.
