The Freedom of Letting Go
Is there anything you feel you could never give up? Trust God with everything to experience complete freedom.
Our heavenly Father is interested in every detail of our life. If we want Him to work in a particular area—relationships, finances, vocation, habits, or something else—we must be willing to let go and give whatever He asks of us.
We may think we have no attachments that come between us and the Lord, but He knows our heart. Ask Him to guide you and help you come to a place of being able to say, “Lord, if that’s what You desire, I commit it to You. You have the right to claim it at any time, so it’s Yours right now.”
It’s difficult to be completely obedient if we’re holding on to something too tightly. The Lord wants us to be attached exclusively to Him. You may have multitudes of things that God has blessed you with, but the moment any of it has a hold on you, His work in your life will be blocked. But when you open your hands, gripping nothing, the Holy Spirit’s power can flow unimpeded through you. Then you will be able to experience freedom.
Is there anything you feel you could never give up? Seriously consider whether it holds you captive (Romans 6:19-23). Release that relationship, possession, or situation to the Lord right now so He can give you the freedom you’ve been craving.
