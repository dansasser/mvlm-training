When God asks us to wait, we can be certain that He intends for a blessing to follow.
No one likes waiting, but doing so is often the wisest course of action for everyday choices as well as for larger, more consequential ones. Developing a patient spirit is also essential when it comes to living the Christian life (Galatians 5:22).
Thankfully, we have countless examples both in Scripture and throughout church history that can help us cultivate a spirit of endurance in our own life. In today’s passage, the apostle James encourages believers with an agricultural metaphor many of them would have understood well—the early and late rains. In the Middle East, water is scarce, so farmers must plan their work accordingly. Some plant in October and November, after the early rains have softened the ground. Then they harvest in April and May, after the later rains have brought crops to peak quality. In between, the only thing farmers can do is wait, trusting the crops will flourish. Sometimes the same thing is true of our life.
Urging that we stay strong, James reminds us about the prophets and Job—they all endured hardships and experienced God’s deliverance in the end. Their example is worth following because, as Scripture promises, “In due time we will reap, if we do not become weary” (Galatians 6:9).
