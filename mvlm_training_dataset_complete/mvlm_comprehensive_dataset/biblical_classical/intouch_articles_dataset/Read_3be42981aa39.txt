The Struggle With Temptation
Through the Holy Spirit's power, we have the ability to reject temptation and avoid sin.
1 Corinthians 10:11-13
1 Corinthians 10:11-13
No matter what specific form temptation takes in our life, the Enemy uses a fairly standard process to get us off track—and it is as effective as ever.
First, we begin to think about the object of our desire. We daydream about it, imagining how we would feel if it were ours. It’s important to ask ourselves if this might be indication of an attempt to redirect our focus.
Next, the thought builds until it gives way to full-blown desire. This intense longing is the culmination of our imaginings. We’re no longer content simply to enjoy the object in our mind; now, we must actually have it.
Finally, the desire leads to a choice. Here is where we make the decision: Will I give in to this sin, or will I lay it down and submit to the Lord’s will for my life?
Through the Holy Spirit’s power, we have the ability to walk away at any point in the process of temptation (2 Peter 1:3). We are never helpless to defuse the situation, no matter how much momentum has built up.
Do you ever feel as if you are powerless to stop a growing temptation in your life? Understanding the nature of this process can help you to make decisions that bring glory to the Lord.
