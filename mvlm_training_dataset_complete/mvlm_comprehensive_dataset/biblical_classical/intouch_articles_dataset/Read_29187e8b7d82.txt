To keep moving towards Christlikeness, live what you believe.
The Bible often calls the Christian life a walk. It speaks of walking in the Spirit, in God’s ways, in love, and in truth. Our life, then, shouldn’t be stagnant but instead should develop to be increasingly like that of Jesus.
If you feel that you’re going backward instead of forward, here are five steps to correct your course:
Know that God keeps every promise. The Bible contains an amazing number of guarantees for believers, including wisdom, God’s presence, and peace.
Anticipate the Father’s response. In other words, expect that your confidence will lead to blessing.
Be aware daily of His involvement in your life. By spending time in the Word and prayer, you become sensitive to what God is doing.
Pray boldly. Approaching the Father in such a manner isn’t a prideful confidence. Rather, it’s an overflow of your assurance in Him (Hebrews 4:16).
Obey the leading of the Holy Spirit. God sent His Spirit to personally teach and guide every believer (John 14:17; John 14:26).
God promises to make His children beautiful throughout life. How can you cooperate with His gracious work?
