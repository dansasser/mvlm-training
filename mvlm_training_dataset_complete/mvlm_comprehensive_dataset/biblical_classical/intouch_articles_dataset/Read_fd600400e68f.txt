The Spiritual Discipline of Fasting
Fasting involves a strong desire to hear from God and a willingness to abstain from distractions.
Fasting has two important components. One is abstention, which eliminates distractions. The other is undivided attention on God, which allows connection with Him on a deeper level.
Daniel was living under captivity in Babylon when he read God’s promise to free the Israelites after a certain number of years. So he sought God through prayer and fasting (Daniel 9:2-3). Then, through the angel Gabriel, the Lord gave the young man greater understanding of what He had previously pledged.
Scripture contains other examples as well. When Jehoshaphat learned that a powerful army was coming, he called for all of Judah to fast (2 Chronicles 20:1-4). The practice was also part of the early church’s preparation for choosing missionaries (Acts 13:2).
The purpose of this spiritual discipline isn’t to bring a quicker answer from God or persuade Him to follow our plan. Instead, it prepares us to see our situation through His eyes and to act on what we learn.
Fasting involves a strong desire to hear from God, a period of time to connect with Him, and a willingness to abstain from distractions that could interfere with our receptivity. If the idea intimidates you, remember its purpose: Fasting prepares us to draw closer to God and receive His encouragement and direction.
