Running the Race of Faith
All believers reach a finish line in life—are you running to receive an eternal prize?
1 Corinthians 3:11-15
Imagine you’re running in a marathon, and one of the athletes decides to pick his own path. He keeps to the 26.2-mile race standard and sets his finish line in the same spot as the official one, but he picks routes with fewer hills and competitors. His plan seems excellent to him, but when he crosses the finish line, there will be no medal or ribbon waiting.
That would certainly be a silly thing to do. Yet we can fall into this very trap when we decide the course for our life instead of running the race God sets. (See Heb. 12:1.) By submitting to His will, we remain on the right path. But the moment we revert to old habits or start making decisions based on our own wisdom, we go far afield.
Whether believers run the race God’s way or their own way, they’ll reach a finish line—but that doesn’t mean it’s the same one. No one wants to look back and realize, I didn’t run the course meant for me. I accomplished nothing of value. The only truly lasting and worthwhile deeds are those done for the Lord in the power of His Spirit (1 Corinthians 3:11-15).
And thankfully, no matter how far off course we veer, the Holy Spirit is still present. He reminds us of the right path—and gives us the power to get back on it and persevere.
