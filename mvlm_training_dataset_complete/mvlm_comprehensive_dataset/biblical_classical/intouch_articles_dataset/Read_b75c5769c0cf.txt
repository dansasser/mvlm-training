Don’t Waste Your Adversities
If you choose to trust and obey God, trials become instruments of blessing.
Are you making the most of your troubles? Anytime the Lord allows trials to enter your life, He has a purpose for them (Genesis 50:20). He wants you to squeeze out every bit of spiritual growth instead of letting difficulties squeeze you into despair and discouragement. If you’ll respond in the right manner, the trial that looks as if it could destroy you becomes an instrument of blessing.
The most natural response to adversity is to plead with God to remove it. If that doesn’t work, we might get angry or try to find our own way out of the difficulty or pain. Sometimes we resort to blaming others for the trouble. And the truth is, someone else might have caused the problem, but ultimately God allowed it. No matter where affliction originates, God has always known about the situation and will use it in accomplishing His good purpose. If we could foresee every benefit the Lord designed our trials to accomplish, maybe we’d trust Him more.
Although we can’t see all the specifics of God’s plan, we know that His goal is to use our adversity to supply something we lack so we can be mature and complete. So don’t waste the opportunity. Even though the experience is painful, rest in the Father’s comforting arms, and let Him do His perfect work in you.
