Megaphones for Christ
If Jesus has changed your life, feel free to let people know!
1 Thessalonians 1:1-10
1 Thessalonians 1:1-10
Imagine that you’re at a professional sports event. Thousands of people cheer loudly, as if their shouts could actually will their team to victory. How many believers do you know who put that same passion and intensity into their faith?
In his letter to the church at Thessalonica, the apostle Paul rejoiced in the congregation’s passion for telling the world about Christ. Because the city was a busy seaport, the church there had the ear of the entire world. Travelers would hear the gospel and then take it back and share it with their own communities.
Paul praised the Thessalonians because “the word of the Lord … sounded forth” from them (1 Thess. 1:8). The apostle painted a powerful word picture. The Greek verb he used refers to a sound that projects like a trumpet blast or thunder. So Paul was praising the Thessalonians for being living megaphones proclaiming Christ.
If you’re a “fan” of Jesus, then you have the responsibility of sharing with the world who He is and what He has done for you. Shout it from the rooftops! Fill entire stadiums with the thunder of your praise! Don’t just show the people around you who your favorite sports team is. Make sure they know who your Savior is as well.
