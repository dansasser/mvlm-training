David: A Picture of God’s Sovereignty
No matter how difficult our situation, we can trust that God is in control.
Sometimes it’s hard to understand God’s purposes for adversity. But the truth is, God works all things for our good.
David’s writings illustrate the importance of trusting that the Lord is in control, no matter how difficult the situation. God spared him when he was running for his life from King Saul and again when he yielded to temptation with Bathsheba. Later, when his son attempted a coup, God protected David and preserved his throne. Through all of these unfortunate circumstances, it became clear that God was guarding and guiding him every step of the way—and using him for extraordinary purposes, despite his human failings. These experiences taught David to trust wholeheartedly in the Lord’s sovereignty.
Those of us in challenging situations must ask ourselves, Do I believe God is in control? If He’s not, who is? In other words, if life events are random and without purpose, then to whom do we turn during trials?
In 1 Chronicles 29:12, David says that God rules over everything and has the power to strengthen you. Have faith in the Lord’s ability to deliver you from any hardship. Though you may not always understand His reasons, you can nevertheless trust His purposes.
