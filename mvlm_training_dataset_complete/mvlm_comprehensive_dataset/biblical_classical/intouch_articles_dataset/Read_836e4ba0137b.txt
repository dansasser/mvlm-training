Responding to Hardship
Trials are an opportunity to see God work on our behalf in ways we can’t imagine.
When you are going through a trial, what’s your first response? Do you want to run away as quickly as possible to escape it? Though that’s a normal feeling, God has a different way. It is not the trials in our life that develop or destroy us, but rather our response to those hardships. How, then, should we react when difficulties feel overwhelming?
First, trust God. God wants His children to believe His Word and reflect on ways He’s been faithful in the past. He assures us that He limits our trials and enables us to endure (1 Corinthians 10:13).
Second, persevere. Even when we don’t understand and the pain seems too much to bear, we shouldn’t quit. We’re to continue seeking the Lord through His Word and prayer. So, let’s cling to hope in Christ and praise Him in the midst of the pain.
Third, remember the Lord is in control. He allows adversity for a reason and demonstrates His sustaining power through it. Even though the pain might feel intolerable, God will never leave our side. Scripture compares our growth to gold, which is refined through fire (1 Peter 1:7).
We will encounter difficulties—sometimes intense and painful trials that seem too much for us. Yet we can rely on our heavenly Father to deliver and guide us in ways we could never imagine. He doesn’t expect that we endure on our own, but He does want us to respond with faith.
