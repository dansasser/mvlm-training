The Gift of Second Chances
God’s desire to forgive and restore is always greater than our capacity to fail.
Before we discuss today’s verses, let’s look at one other passage. Take the time to read Matthew 26:69-75 and consider Peter’s emotions in that moment. The more people asked about his relationship to Jesus, the more emphatic his denials became. At first he said, “I do not know what you are talking about” (v. 70). Then he denied Jesus with an oath, and finally “began to curse and swear” (vv. 72-74).
But when the rooster crowed, he remembered his words from the night before: “I will never fall away!” He had even gone so far as to declare he’d never deny Jesus, even if it meant dying with Him (Matthew 26:31-35). For all that false bravado, the apostle failed exactly as Jesus said he would. No wonder he sobbed bitterly.
A few days later, when he saw Jesus on the shore, Peter hurled himself into the sea and hurried to his Savior. Imagine how it must have felt to stand there, dripping wet, staring at the One you loved and had betrayed. After the meal, Jesus allowed Peter to rewrite his answers that had been given in a haze of panic and fear. And with each affirmation, the disciple knew he was both forgiven and profoundly loved. Jesus offers that same experience to us, now and always. He never stops seeking, never stops offering forgiveness to all who call Him Lord and Savior.
