When we trust Jesus as Savior, the Holy Spirit comes to live in us so He can accomplish God's will through our life.
A vinedresser plants and tends his vines for the purpose of seeing them produce grapes. God, as our vinedresser, encourages us to bear spiritual fruit. He wants our character to show that we are new creatures (2 Corinthians 5:17)—marked by love, peace, and compassion rather than hatred, anger, and selfishness. For this reason, believers are grafted into Jesus Christ, the living vine.
Luke 4:1 describes the Lord as “full of the Holy Spirit” following His baptism. Jesus’ life and ministry were the result of the Spirit’s empowerment—and when we become believers, God sends the very same Helper to indwell us. In the language of vineyards, the sap from the vine flows into a grafted branch, giving it life and the capacity to grow the kind of fruit typical of that plant. The branch and the vine become one, and for that to occur, we should be “rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith ... and overflowing with thankfulness” (Col. 2:7 NIV).
Once we trust in Jesus as Savior, the Spirit of God lives His life through us. When we are obediently following the Lord, our joy and peace are not dependent upon circumstances, and the One in whom we are rooted is our joy and peace.
