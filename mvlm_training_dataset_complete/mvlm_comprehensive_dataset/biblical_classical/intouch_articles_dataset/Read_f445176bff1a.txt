The Lord provides what we need—even when it's not what we want.
The people didn’t realize the significance of their words: “Hosanna to the Son of David,” they called out as Jesus rode by. “Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord” (Matthew 21:9).
We know the day as Palm Sunday. But for the Jews, it was the day to choose a lamb for the annual Passover sacrifice. Years before, when His people were still in bondage, God warned that death was on its way to afflict every household, whether righteous or wicked. The Lord, however, provided a way out: All who took shelter under the blood of a spotless lamb would live.
So for years, God’s people brought sacrifices and prayed, Save us, please, as blood spilled from every offering. But the blood of bulls and lambs couldn’t fully purify them (Hebrews 10:4). The people of God were covered but not cleansed.
Then came that Palm Sunday, when the people were celebrating an earthly ruler they assumed would break the heavy yoke of Rome. They wanted freedom. But God had a freedom of a much more beautiful kind on His heart. His people thought they were choosing their king, but God was choosing their Lamb.
“Save us, please!” is answered today the way it was then: We were redeemed “with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ” (1 Peter 1:18-19).
