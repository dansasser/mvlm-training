Discerning God’s Goodness
Some of God's gifts are experiences we wouldn't choose, but they are always beneficial.
Because the goodness of God is perfect, He alone can accurately determine what is best for each person. His kindness is expressed in more ways than simply the provision of wealth, health, and relationships. Some divine gifts are experiences we would never choose, but the Lord knows we need them in order to grow in faith, obedience, and perseverance.
Consider these expressions of God’s goodness toward us:
Loving Discipline. Since God’s love is unfailing, He corrects us when we need it. The process is painful, but the result is “the peaceful fruit of righteousness” (Hebrews 12:11).
Wise Limitations. With His perfect insight, the Lord lovingly withholds things that would be detrimental to us spiritually.
Useful Suffering. God knows which refining experiences we need in order to become fruitful in His kingdom. What appears to us as a valley of hardship is His place of preparation for godliness and service.
It can be tempting to interpret God’s character on the basis of our circumstances. But when evidence compels us to doubt His goodness, it’s important to remember this: His gifts may come in a variety of shapes and sizes but are always beneficial. As Psalm 34:8 says, “O taste and see that the Lord is good.”
