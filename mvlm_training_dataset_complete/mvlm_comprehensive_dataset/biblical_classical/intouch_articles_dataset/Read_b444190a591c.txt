God Accomplishes What Concerns You
Our job is to believe and obey; God is responsible for the outcomes in our life.
David walked through trouble on a regular basis. His psalms express the struggles and disappointments he faced, yet in the end, he always turned his focus back to God. The key to his victorious attitude was strong faith in the Lord.
David was confident in God’s purpose. That’s why he could say, “The Lord will accomplish what concerns me” (Ps. 138:8). By keeping our focus on the Lord and His purpose, we can stay strong when we walk through trouble.
He relied on the Lord’s power. In times of difficulty, we can trust God to deliver us too—though the outcome may not be what we expect. Remember, our Father will sustain us through the trial, walking with us every step of the way.
David believed the promises of God. He penned today’s two verses to repeatedly remind himself what the Lord would do. We also need some specific promises from Scripture that will anchor us in times of trouble. The truths of the Bible are our most valuable possession when the storms of life assail us.
God assumes responsibility for accomplishing what concerns you in times of trouble. Your job is to believe that the Lord will fulfill His purpose, has power adequate to the task, and will keep every promise He has made. Keep walking with your eyes on Him.
