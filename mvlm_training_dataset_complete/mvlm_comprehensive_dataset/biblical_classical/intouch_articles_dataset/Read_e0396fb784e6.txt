The Cross: Grace Displayed
Because Jesus died, we gain abundant life, unconditional love, and a relationship with our heavenly Father.
At Calvary, God displayed His grace for the entire world. The cross represents the intersection of His holiness and His love.
Our holy God is without fault—so “perfectly perfect” that no man or woman can look upon Him and live (Exodus 33:20). We, however, are sinners. We were all born with a sin nature, which left us separated from God.
It’s important to understand that the Lord hates sin because it harms the ones He loves. Remember that God is love (1 John 4:8)—He created us to have a relationship with Him and desires that all people spend eternity with Him (2 Peter 3:9). Yet there remains the problem of our sin.
The Lord will not violate His own nature and compromise His holiness. Prompted by His own great love, therefore, He made a way to have a relationship with us: He put the sin of all mankind on Jesus Christ’s shoulders.
The Father sent His holy Son to be a perfect sacrifice on our behalf. Jesus Christ took our sin upon Himself and died on the cross in our place. When we trust Him as our Savior and receive His forgiveness, we are made new—holy, perfect, and welcome in our Father’s presence.
