When Our Faith Wavers
We access all the riches of God with the simple decision to trust Him—in everything.
Faith is the heart of our Christian life. It’s how we are saved, receive forgiveness for our sins, enjoy a personal relationship with God, and have assurance of eternal life in His presence. By faith, we experience the peace of God and the power of the Holy Spirit. Yet at times our life and prayers are plagued by doubts.
Our faith wavers when we. . .
Apply human thinking to our circumstances. Sometimes God may require us to do something with which human reasoning disagrees (Isaiah 55:9).
Allow our feelings to overcome our faith. Perhaps feelings of unworthiness, fear, or inadequacy cause us to doubt we can do what the Lord asks.
Fail to see God at work in our circumstances. Doubts creep in when we have asked Him to take action but nothing appears to be happening.
Have guilt over sin, past or present. We cannot operate with strong faith when we are mindful of ongoing sin or dwelling on guilt over past wrongdoing.
Faith is defined as “the certainty of things hoped for, a proof of things not seen” (Hebrews 11:1). Do confidence and conviction describe the condition of your faith?
