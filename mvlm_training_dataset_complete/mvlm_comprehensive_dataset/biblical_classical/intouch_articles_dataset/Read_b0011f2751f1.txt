Learning to Pray God’s Way
God may include delays as part of His perfect answer to our prayers.
We like to keep things uncomplicated: Follow a few steps and reach the preferred result. Prayer, however, cannot be reduced to such an easy formula. It isn’t some transactional activity where repeating certain words brings the desired solution. It’s ongoing communication with the heavenly Father and involves listening, speaking, and acting on what we hear from Him.
God has promised to answer His children’s prayers, but He often waits before responding. He does so for many reasons:
Preparation. Sometimes God has to make us ready for what He wants to give us. We may have attitudes or behaviors that aren’t aligned with His will (James 4:3).
Spiritual growth. The Lord may use delays to test our faith or deepen our relationship with Him.
Timing. God’s timetable often doesn’t match ours. He knows what He wants to accomplish in and through us.
God includes delays as part of the believer’s prayer life. In certain situations, we—like the persevering widow in Luke 18:1-8—have to keep knocking before the Lord gives us His answer.
Jesus calls us to a lifestyle of “asking, seeking, and knocking”—a lifestyle of trust in the Father’s promise to answer His children.
