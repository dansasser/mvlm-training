Responding to God’s Love
Have you accepted God's free gift of salvation?
God is love. Most likely, we’ve heard these words, but do we really understand what they mean? John 3:16 tells us: Because the Father deeply loves us, He sent His Son in human flesh to live on earth and to save us by dying. This is no shallow love.
Some people question Jesus’ sacrifice, though. They think, Certainly the Lord could have come up with a different way to offer salvation. He is God, so shouldn’t He be able to do all things? They fail to consider two of His unchangeable attributes.
First, God is holy by nature. This means He cannot look upon sin with approval. Second, He is just. As a result, all wrongdoing—without exception—must be dealt with (Romans 6:23).
We all fall short of God’s perfect holiness (Romans 3:23). But our heavenly Father desires an everlasting relationship with us, so He provided the solution by sending His Son Jesus here to live as a man and then die on the cross. This is the ultimate expression of love. As 1 John 4:10 states, “In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.”
Have you accepted God’s free gift of salvation? How do you choose to respond to His amazing love?
