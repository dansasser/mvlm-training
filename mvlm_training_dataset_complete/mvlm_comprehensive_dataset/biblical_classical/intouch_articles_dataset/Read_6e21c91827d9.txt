How to Foster True Friendships
Friendships don't just happen—they require time and effort.
Most of us long to be in genuine relationships. God created us with this need, as we were not meant to live in isolation. But healthy friendships don’t just happen. They require effort.
Yesterday, in looking to Jonathan and David for a biblical model of godly companions, we saw how mutual respect is vital in a healthy friendship. Now, let’s look at two more aspects of their relationship.
First, they had a deep bond of love—described as souls that were “knit” together (1 Sam. 18:1 KJV). Second, they exhibited profound devotion, which is a type of commitment that involves giving. To show loyalty, Jonathan gave his friend gifts of his robe and military gear. But both men selflessly offered more: Jonathan even risked his life and future kingship to save David from execution. Notice, too, that Jonathan was often the initiator and the one who gave more. He was a prince, whereas David was a shepherd. Social status shouldn’t interfere with cultivating a true friendship.
We were designed for true companionship based on mutual respect, love, and commitment. This requires not only time and selfless devotion but also transparency—which means being real, even about our faults. Taking such a risk requires trust, but the blessings are well worth the effort.
