Are you trying to be good enough to go to heaven?
Three of the four Gospels contain an account of a young man who asked Jesus a very important question: “What shall I do to inherit eternal life?” (Luke 18:18). A ruler with great wealth, he considered himself to be a moral man because he had kept God’s commandments.
However, he was operating under the incorrect assumption that good works bring about salvation. He seemed to be asking what else he had to do—besides the good things he’d already accomplished—in order to secure his place in heaven. It is a false belief that eternal life can be earned through our own efforts. Scripture teaches that all mankind has inherited a sinful nature (Romans 5:12) and, therefore, being saved is not of our own doing.
If this were the end of the story, we would be a people without hope, both now and in the future. But the good news is that the Father recognized our plight and mercifully provided the way to reconcile us to Him (John 14:6). When God made us in His image, He created us to live forever. So, though our earthly bodies will perish, our spirit will never die. Therefore, we should be grateful, choosing to live in a way that pleases the Lord. But we do so, knowing that our good deeds are motivated by love that comes from our salvation—not striving to earn it.
