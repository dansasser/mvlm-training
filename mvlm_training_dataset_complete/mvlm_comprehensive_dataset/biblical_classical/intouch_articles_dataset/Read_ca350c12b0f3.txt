God’s Grace and Holiness
God's grace offers salvation to all people—and it also teaches us how to live well.
One of the grandest expressions of the gospel is found in Titus 2:11, where Paul tells us, “
For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people” (NIV). How could there be any better news than that? What was invisible for many centuries has now come into view. Moreover, this grace has appeared for all people, not just a chosen few. It is what the apostle elsewhere calls “the power of God for salvation” (Romans 1:16).
With such power at our disposal, we’re sometimes disappointed to find that grace, while beautiful, also involves pain. To most people, the word power suggests instant transformation and easy accomplishment. We often forget that grace is a schoolteacher whose lesson plan includes very specific instructions.
In Titus 2:12, we learn what that plan entails. This teacher has appeared, “instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously, and in a godly manner.” We can learn to say no to sin. We can learn what holiness is and find ways to acquire and display it. Only through God’s grace can we even attempt to live a righteous life.
Such learning may take time. But progress in this school is just as much a tribute to God’s grace as the instant changes that sometimes occur right after a person gets saved.
