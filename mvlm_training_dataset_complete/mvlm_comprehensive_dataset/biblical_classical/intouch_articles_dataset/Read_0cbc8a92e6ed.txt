God is ready to move in the lives of those who trust Him—even when they don't understand His plan.
Ask yourself, What kind of light am I? Is your glow a little dull—a flicker others can see only if they’re really looking? Or do you brighten everything up when you walk into a room? As Christians, we should shine brilliantly, no matter where we are.
One thing that may dim our radiance is shortsightedness. Before agreeing to obey the Lord, we may think we have to see exactly what He plans to do. But we’re called to be faithful ambassadors who trust His Spirit to work as He wants. It’s as if God were saying, Don’t give Me a schedule—trust Me. Watch Me do things My way in My time, and see what happens.
You’re deeply loved by the Lord. And as a member of God’s family, you are indwelt by His Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19). His light is the radiance within you. You have no idea what amazing things He can do—in the workplace, at school, or with family, neighbors, or friends—through your willingness to shine the light of His powerful love.
If you’ll get on your knees and pray, “Lord, I’m available. Do whatever You want with my life, and show me what You desire,” He’ll reveal the next step. God is willing and ready to move in the life of anyone who chooses to be available for Him.
