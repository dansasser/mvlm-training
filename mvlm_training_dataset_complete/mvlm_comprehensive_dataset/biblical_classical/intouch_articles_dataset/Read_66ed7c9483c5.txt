Blessed to Bless Others
When we make giving a priority, God's grace overflows in our life.
God’s blessings to us aren’t meant to end with us. His desire is that they filter down to others. This principle applies in all areas of our life, including finances. Did you know that our heavenly Father has plans for our money?
The Lord supplies us with income so we can provide for our needs and, often, our wants. But He also wants us to use our money to achieve His plans. And one of His goals is that we share our resources with others. If we purpose in our hearts to participate in His plans, He commits to provide all we need.
Just look at His extravagant promise in verse 8 of today’s passage: “And God is able to make all grace overflow to you, so that, always having all sufficiency in everything, you may have an abundance for every good deed.” This encouraging scripture is a good reminder that when we share blessings with others, God promises to enrich us in response to our generosity. In other words, He will increase the harvest of our righteousness.
A hoarded blessing isn’t enjoyed as richly as a shared one. Using your gift to meet someone else’s need glorifies God by demonstrating His grace at work in your life. Don’t let His generous provisions end with you. Pass them on and discover the joy of a never-ending cycle of blessings.
