New Mercies Every Morning
God's faithfulness in caring for us changes everything.
The prophet Jeremiah knew the sorrow of a dark night. He’s often called the weeping prophet because of the tears he cried over the destruction of Jerusalem and the sinfulness of her people. But even in his sorrow, Jeremiah was able to hold on to hope. He remained confident that both God’s people and the city of Jerusalem would be restored, thanks to the Father’s faithfulness and unending mercy.
For Jeremiah, confidence stemmed from trusting in God, and the same can be true for us. No matter what difficulties arise, we have God’s promise that He is faithful to care for us. That promise changes everything—trusting in God’s faithfulness and mercy allows us to cling to unwavering hope for the future.
Jesus’ words in Matthew 6:30-32 underscore Jeremiah’s heart cry: “Do not worry then, saying, ‘What are we to eat?’ or ‘What are we to drink?’ or ‘What are we to wear for clothing?’ …for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.” God is fully aware of our needs and will be faithful to meet them. His mercies are available to us every single day. Let’s be deliberate about leaning into those mercies, as Jeremiah was. And we, too, can look forward to experiencing confidence and peace.
