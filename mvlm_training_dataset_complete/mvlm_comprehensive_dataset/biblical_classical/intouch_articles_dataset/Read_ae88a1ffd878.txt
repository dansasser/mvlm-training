When we are willing to face our guilt, Jesus replaces our burden of shame with peace and joy.
At times people are bound by guilt longer than they should be. For some, it’s because they’re living in sin. But others suffer from false guilt because they harbor shame that doesn’t belong to them. Whatever the root cause, however, the way to triumph over guilt is the same.
Victory begins with understanding that the Savior took our shame to the cross (Hebrews 12:2). Without Jesus, the debt wouldn’t have been settled, because there’s no way that we can pay for our own sin. But we do need to identify the source of our guilt and confess before God. That means we agree with His perspective on what we’ve done—in other words, we admit when we’ve committed an offense. Repentance goes a step further: We turn away from wrong and choose to do right.
Confronting guilt in this way replaces our burden of shame with peace and joy. And an amazing side effect is that we have wisdom to share. Openness about our past mistakes can reveal the Lord to those in our sphere of influence. Through our witness, God may reach others who need their chains broken.
The battle to overcome guilt is one that should not be delayed. Turn to the Lord and ask Him to help you face the source of your guilt. It’s time to start walking in the joy of God’s blessings instead.
