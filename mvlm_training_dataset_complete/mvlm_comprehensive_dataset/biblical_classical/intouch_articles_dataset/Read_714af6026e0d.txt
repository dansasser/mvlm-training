The Price of Prayerlessness
God invites us to place our burdens in His capable hands.
God wants us to talk with Him about everything. In fact, Jesus says to ask, seek, and knock (Matthew 7:7-8), assuring us God is ready and willing to respond. But at times, some of us get out of the habit of communicating with our Father except in emergencies.
Forsaking prayer is costly to our well-being. Those who don’t make time every day for God struggle through weariness, discouragement, and doubt. Today we will focus on the first phase—weariness.
Certain situations are burdens that take an emotional, physical, and spiritual toll. Such low points can wear us out if we try to endure them alone. But the Lord does not intend for that weight to fall on our shoulders. In fact, God’s Word tells us to cast those loads on Him (Psalm 55:22). “Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears our burden,” cries David in Psalm 68:19. Remember, it is God who does all the work to straighten out your circumstances.
Carrying our worries and cares around is wearying because we are not built for such loads. In God’s design, His strength fills the believer to capacity. Picture Jesus’ shoulders just above your own—with Him bearing your problems. The burden does not disappear, but it feels blessedly lighter when you hand it over to the Lord.
