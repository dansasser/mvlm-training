Qualifications for Sainthood
When we trust Christ as our Savior, His righteousness is gifted to us.
Have you ever wondered what it takes to be called a saint? The Corinthian church struggled with all sorts of ungodly behaviors, yet Paul describes them as “those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, saints by calling” (1 Cor. 1:2).
Sanctify means to set apart from common use to a sacred use. Throughout the Bible, God has sanctified days (such as the Sabbath), places (the tabernacle), things (the ark of the covenant), and people. A saint is simply a person whom God has set apart for His purposes. This means that every believer is a saint.
Before you were saved, your position relative to God was one of enmity (Romans 5:10). The moment you trusted Jesus as Savior, the Lord changed your position and set you apart for Himself. You were born again and are now His child. He forgave your sins and declared you righteous. A saint is not a perfect person but one who is in a right relationship with the heavenly Father. Although our sanctification is not predicated on good behavior, the Lord expects us to live in a manner that honors Him.
Just think—God set us apart for a sacred purpose. That means we are here to bring glory to Him. And He now calls us to live according to our new position in Christ.
