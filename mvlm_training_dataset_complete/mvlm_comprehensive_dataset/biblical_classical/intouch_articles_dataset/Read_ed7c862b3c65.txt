Our Father, who wants His children to be victorious, has—through Christ—given us everything we need.
Victory is God’s will for the life of a believer. But sometimes we can find ourselves repeatedly falling into the same sin. If we want to do what is right, why do we continue to miss the mark?
One reason is incomplete repentance. It is possible for us to experience grief, embarrassment, and shame over sin without being truly repentant. Repentance isn’t a matter of weeping or feeling guilty; rather, it’s a change of mind about sin so that we no longer hold on to our own perspective but instead agree with God’s viewpoint. When we do this, the heart turns in the opposite direction from persistent wrongdoing (Proverbs 28:13).
The second reason for failure is an inadequate view of our identity in the Lord. We, as children of God, have Christ living within us. When we grasp this truth, we will recognize that sin does not fit who we are, and we’ll stop rationalizing our offenses. Our genuine repentance is based upon an honest and biblical understanding of our identity.
When we put these two truths together, we create a powerful tool against temptation. Our Father wants us to be victorious, and we triumph when we remember that Jesus Christ is the source of our life.
