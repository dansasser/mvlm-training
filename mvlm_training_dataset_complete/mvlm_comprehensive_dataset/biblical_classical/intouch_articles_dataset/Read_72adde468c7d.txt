Finding the Will of God
Following the Lord is a wonderful and satisfying adventure.
Discovering God’s will is an ongoing adventure with wonderful rewards. God’s Word is our map, and the Holy Spirit is our guide. He also provides “road signs” as we travel:
Circumstances. God can communicate through our situations—even negative ones. To discern meaning, we must relate biblical principles to what’s happening, realizing God won’t contradict His Word. Rather, His will always upholds it.
Counsel. God may direct us through wisdom from others.
Conscience. Once our “inner alarm system” has been programmed according to scriptural values, we can use it as a resource to determine God’s plan for our life.
Common Sense. When decisions need to be made quickly, the Spirit helps us make choices that honor God (James 1:5-6).
Compulsion. Sometimes God gives us compelling desires to see to it that certain things happen. If there’s no contradiction with Scripture and our inner feelings remain strong over time, we should likely move ahead.
Contentment. God gives peace when we obey Him.
With the Bible as your itinerary, keep watching for the “road signs” God places in your path.  The heavenly Father does not want you to miss His perfect will for your life.
