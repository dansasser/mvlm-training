The Attitude of a Believer
Are you still thankful for the amazing grace of God in your life?
1 Corinthians 15:9-11
1 Corinthians 15:9-11
The apostle Paul had a certain mindset that Christians would be wise to emulate (1 Corinthians 11:1). In him, we see an attitude of ...
Humility. Pride cannot hide in the heart of a believer who understands divine mercy. Paul believed the grace that was sufficient to save a sinner like him was adequate for anyone.
Indebtedness. The apostle never lost sight of how far the Father’s grace had brought him. Paul frequently reminded followers of his role in persecuting the church (1 Timothy 1:13), and his gratitude for salvation never waned.
Dependence. To describe the source of his strength, Paul said: “By the grace of God I am what I am” (1 Cor. 15:10). He knew what it was like to depend upon one’s own goodness and work to be religious—and he wanted no part of it. Paul desired more of Jesus Christ and less of himself (Philippians 3:8).
Conviction. At the end of his life, Paul was as confident that God was worthy of all honor, glory, and praise as he was right after his initial encounter with Jesus. (2 Timothy 4:6-8).
Do you see these attitudes in yourself? Praise God for all He’s done for you and allow His grace to be poured out on your life in ever-greater ways.
