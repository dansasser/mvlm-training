Principles of Obedience
Obedience, even in small matters, leads to blessing for us and others.
Obedience is a fundamental part of the Christian life. Peter’s interaction with Jesus by the Sea of Galilee illustrates three important principles.
Obeying in small matters has eternal significance and leads to blessings from God. A seemingly small act—loaning a boat to Jesus—resulted in Peter’s call to become a fisher of men.
Following Jesus is often beneficial to others. For one thing, Peter’s action made it possible for more people to hear Jesus. Later on, when Peter lowered nets back into the water at the Lord’s’ request, his obedience meant a big catch. When we live out biblical principles, our families will be enriched, and those within our circle of influence will be encouraged.
God may call for action that makes little sense. He told Noah to build an ark (Genesis 6:14); He instructed Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac (Genesis 22:2); and He directed Joshua to conquer Jericho by marching silently for six days and shouting on the seventh (Joshua 6:3-5). All of these men agreed to God’s plan; their trust in Him overruled any concerns and led to great reward.
The Lord has a plan for our eternal good, and it is foolish not to obey Him. Like Peter, we have no idea what God will do in and through us if we commit to a life of obedience.
