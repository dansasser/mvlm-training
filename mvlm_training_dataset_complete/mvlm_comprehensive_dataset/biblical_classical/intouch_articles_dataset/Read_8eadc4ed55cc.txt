Listen for the Lord's voice—even when you are helping others—to be sure you are doing His will.
Believers are called to be compassionate (Luke 10:37), but we must show discernment when practicing kindness. At times, stepping into someone’s life can block what God is doing with that person. Let’s look at Peter, who once allowed feelings to cloud his discernment. Attempting to interfere in the divine plan for Jesus Christ was an experience that he likely never forgot.
Though Peter knew exactly who Jesus was—namely, the Messiah and Son of the living God (Matthew 16:16)—he also held common Jewish misconceptions about the Messiah’s mission. Many Israelites awaited a king who’d overthrow the oppressive Roman rule. Consequently, Peter refused to accept Jesus’ warnings of the judgment, mistreatment, and death He anticipated. After trying to convince the Lord that such an end was impossible, the disciple was rebuked for attempting to subvert God’s will (Matt. 16:22-23).
Jesus’ priority was to liberate hearts from sin rather than bodies from tyranny. Peter had a narrow view of the divine plan, and wrong perceptions led him into open rebellion. Do not make his mistake. Since we never want to obstruct God’s unfolding purposes, it’s always wise to seek His will first—even when unpleasant circumstances appear to warrant a compassionate response.
