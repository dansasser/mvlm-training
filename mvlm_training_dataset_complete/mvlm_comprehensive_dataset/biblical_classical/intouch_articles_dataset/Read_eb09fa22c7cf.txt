Temptation is an enticement to take a God-given desire beyond God-given boundaries.
Everyone experiences temptation. No matter how mature in the faith you are or how long you’ve followed Christ, you have been tempted. Sometimes this seems like a faint whisper in your mind, and other times, an unbearable shout. You know what temptation feels like. But if someone asked, could you define the term?
In and of itself, temptation is not a sin; it is simply an enticement to take a God-given desire beyond God-given boundaries. Sin occurs when we give in to that allurement. Many people, however, refuse to believe temptation could be even remotely related to a desire God intended for us to experience.
But think about it: In what ways are you most often tempted? In the area of material possessions? Companionship? Food? These are all things that God planned as blessings for His people. The problem comes when we take those drives beyond the healthy limits that the Creator has set for our life.
One of the Enemy’s top strategies is to distort a holy desire. Whenever you face temptation, ask the Lord to remind you where this urge came from in the first place. Then pray for the strength not to be deceived or “led astray from the simplicity and purity of devotion to Christ” (2 Corinthians 11:3).
