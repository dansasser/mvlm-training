A Relationship With God
The Lord wants you to discover the freedom, satisfaction, and joy found through a relationship with Him.
Intimate relationships are characterized by a close connection with another person and a commitment to his or her well-being. Acquaintances have superficial information about us, but true friends know our deeper emotions, thoughts, and desires—and God wants to have this kind of relationship with us.
However, human sinfulness made that seem impossible. We all were born with an inherited sin nature (Romans 5:12) and have rebelled against God’s perfect authority (Romans 3:23; Romans 6:23). Neither good works nor moral values can overcome the problem. Thankfully, God’s solution is to change our nature so we can be a part of His family. However, divine justice must still be satisfied, and only a perfect sacrifice can pay for our sins (Deuteronomy 17:1). Throughout history, only one qualified: Jesus, who gave His life so we could have a relationship with the Father.
The Father has done everything necessary for us to be in His family and experience intimacy with Him. Have you entered into a relationship with Him through the saving work of His Son? If not, make today your spiritual birthday by receiving Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior. This Christmas season, discover the gifts of freedom, satisfaction, and joy that are found in Him.
