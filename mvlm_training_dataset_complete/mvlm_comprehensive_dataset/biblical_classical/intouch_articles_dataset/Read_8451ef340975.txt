When God’s Ways Are Not Our Ways
A humble and trusting heart allows us to accept rather than resist God's will.
How do you respond when God says no? What if you requested something good—or even godly—and God doesn’t merely withhold but says, “No, I’m giving this good thing to someone else”?
David built a kingdom and then erected a palace for himself. It was evident (to him) that the next thing to construct was a temple for God. Why should he, a mere man, live in luxury while the Lord had nothing more than the old tabernacle tent? It was such an obvious next step, in fact, that the prophet Nathan didn’t even inquire of the Lord. He told David to go right ahead. “Do whatever is in your heart,” he said, “for God is with you” (1 Chron. 17:2).
But God said no. That night, the Lord met Nathan in a vision and gave him the unenviable task of telling the king—one of the most powerful men in the known world—that he could not pursue this task. Rather, his son Solomon would be the one to do it (1 Chronicles 28:6).
David wasn’t a perfect man by any means, but his response to this news demonstrates faith and the ability to surrender to God’s will. Instead of resisting, David came before God with thanksgiving, worship, and awe—and blessed His name. David found contentment and gave praise for all the Lord had done for him. May his example be one that comes to mind when we face delays and disappointments.
