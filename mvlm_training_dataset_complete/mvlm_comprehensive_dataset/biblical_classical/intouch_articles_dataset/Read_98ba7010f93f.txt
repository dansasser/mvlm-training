Unashamed to Share the Gospel
We have a responsibility to share the gospel, but the outcome is in God's hands.
The apostle Paul understood the awesome responsibility of being entrusted with the gospel of Jesus Christ. He considered this calling a stewardship for which he would one day give an account to the Lord, and he was willing to do anything—even suffer—for Christ’s sake. As believers, we have this same privilege to share the gospel with people God places in our life.
Paul felt compelled to tell others about Christ. In fact, he said, “Woe is me if I do not” (1 Corinthians 9:16). No matter how anyone treated him, he wasn’t ashamed of the message of Christ. The prophet Jeremiah had a similar experience (Jeremiah 20:7-9). He became a laughingstock and was persecuted for delivering God’s message of the coming judgment. Yet he discovered that not speaking created a far worse feeling in his heart—like fire shut up in his bones.
We are surrounded by people who are desperately hungry for something, and they don’t even know what. We have the answer—and the responsibility to share it. Never be ashamed of the best news ever offered to mankind. It’s the only thing that can change someone’s eternal destiny.
