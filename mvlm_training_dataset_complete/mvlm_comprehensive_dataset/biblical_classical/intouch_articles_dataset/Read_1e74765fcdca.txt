The Hidden Dangers of Insecurity
Insecurity is a prison that can hinder development of fulfilling relationships.
Insecurity may not sound as dangerous as things like pride or jealousy, but it, too, is a hazardous pitfall. And feelings of insecurity can develop from many different situations.
Regardless of the root causes, the effects are often similar. We may be indecisive because our fear of making the wrong choice leads us to avoid decisions altogether. Sometimes we have a difficult time establishing lasting relationships because we’re afraid we won’t be a good friend. Or we might keep our distance from others due to a fear of rejection. Sooner or later, we may become critical of others. At the same time, we can fall into the trap of believing success is based on acceptance by others.
No quick solution exists for overcoming insecurity; it’s not something we can confess and expect instant freedom. Nor can we simply drift into security; improvement usually takes time. It is helpful to try and identify where such feelings come from—and then to turn them over to the Lord (1 Peter 5:7).
The truth is that God has a special path for each of His children (Ephesians 2:10)—a path where success cannot be measured by human praise. Ultimately, we must decide to trust what God says about us and not what the enemy whispers.
