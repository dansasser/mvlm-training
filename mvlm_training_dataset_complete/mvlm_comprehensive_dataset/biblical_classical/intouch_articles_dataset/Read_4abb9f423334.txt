Comparison is a trap that keeps us from God's best for our life.
Envy is like a snowball that grows larger and larger—and the consequences are often devastating. Confusion, anxiety, and bitterness can make it nearly impossible to keep God’s plan in view. Instead, the focus becomes what we don’t have, making us resent those who do have the desired object or trait. Then fear of not measuring up can dominate our thinking. What’s more, covetousness dishonors the Lord. Though He has a beautiful plan for each and every one of His children, envy says, “I don’t trust that You truly give me Your best.”
If you find any evidence of this attitude in your life, confess the comparison mindset. Recognize that you’re focusing on what God is doing in another person’s life rather than in your own. Thank Him for how He is blessing the other person, and ask Him to place a love in your heart for that individual. Then refocus your attention on what the Father is doing in your life. Finally, memorize and meditate on Psalms 37:4-6.
If you’re burdened with envy, then you’re missing out on God’s best. Don’t wait to deal with this sin, which will fester and grow if left unattended. The One who created you and designed a good plan for your life is able to help you correct your mindset.
