Wandering From the Word
The Bible is our most reliable source of information and inspiration for living.
Imagine a man has bought his grandchildren a new toy. After a brief glance at the directions, he sets the booklet aside and gets busy building. A few frustrating hours later, he humbly opens the instructions again and follows the steps to put the toy together. Soon he is done, and the grandkids are playing happily.
The grandfather knew that the manufacturer had a plan for assembling the toy, but he assumed he could figure it out on his own. Many of us approach Scripture the same way. Instead of treating God’s Word like a manual to live by, we’ll glance at it only when we’re at a loss over what to do next.
The Bible teaches believers who God is, what He thinks, and how He acts. Knowing the ways of the Lord ensures that we can make wise decisions that honor Him. The Bible is also God’s instruction book for living (2 Timothy 3:16-17). In today’s passage, we read that if a person wants to be righteous, his or her life must comply with scriptural principles (vv. 9-10)—and the only way to do that is to read, study, and meditate on the Word.
God’s Word is a possession of supreme value. Among the Bible’s riches are stories teaching us how to serve the Lord and live in a way that honors Him. It contains a wealth of instruction for building a righteous and meaningful life.
