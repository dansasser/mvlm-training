Seek Bravely; Knock Boldly
Those who actively pursue God are never disappointed.
Yesterday, we looked at what it means to ask something of God and what we gain by doing so. But we are also told to do two additional things in our pursuit of God: “seek” and “knock.”
All three of the commands come with rock-solid promises: “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you” (Matt. 7:7, emphasis added). Notice the Lord doesn’t say “maybe it will be given,” “perhaps you will find,” or “hopefully it’ll be opened.” He wants us to know that those who seek after Him will never be disappointed. The journey—however long or challenging it might be—will always be worth it.
But what kind of door does Jesus have in mind? It is Himself. In John 10:9 Jesus says, “I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.” Jesus is the door through which we find abundant, eternal life. When we knock, we trust that there is always more goodness in store for those who are in Christ. And when we walk through this open door, it is through faith in Christ on the path of salvation that He alone provides.
When you ask, ask for more of Jesus. When you seek, seek the path of Jesus. And when you knock, knock boldly in the certainty that Jesus will open Himself to you and welcome you home.
