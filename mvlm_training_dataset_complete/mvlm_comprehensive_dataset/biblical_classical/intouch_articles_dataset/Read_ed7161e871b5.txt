What Truth Does for Us
Making honesty our habit enables us to experience the joy and freedom our Savior desires for us.
Before you buy a used vehicle or a house, it’s wise to have an inspection. If there are faulty brakes in a car or mold in a home’s basement, you want to know, right? The truth can help you avoid making a costly—even deadly—mistake. Truth protects us.
This principle applies to our spiritual life too. In today’s passage, Jesus said, “If you continue in My word, then you are truly My disciples; and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free” (vv. 31-32). The Jews were confused. They were, after all, Abraham’s descendants and had “never been enslaved to anyone” (v. 33). Jesus told them that everyone is a slave to sin but that He came to set them free. And He sets us free too.
The truth of the gospel allows us to enter into relationship with our heavenly Father. Then, as we read and study God’s Word, His truth becomes more and more ingrained in our heart. We become so familiar with it that we’re able to recognize wrong teaching. Biblical truth provides guidance, wisdom, strength, courage, comfort, and faith. Living in God’s truth lets us experience the life He wants for us—a life of joy and freedom. How has truth protected and liberated you?
