The Reason for Our Boldness
Is there anything that keeps you from sharing the gospel’s life-changing message?
Most Christians are very familiar with the gospel. However, we’re often still reluctant to share our faith. Perhaps fear of negative reactions or possible questions can keep us silent. What if we don’t have the answers or end up looking like a fool? It can feel intimidating.
But remember, God has given us the most important news in the world. We can’t let fear or ignorance keep us from sharing the only message that can change a person’s eternal destiny. The apostle Paul welcomed opportunities to tell people about Christ, because he was focused on the gospel’s life-changing power rather than the possible negative reactions (Romans 1:15-17). Often, the reason we’re ashamed or scared to talk about our faith is that we’re concerned about ourselves. But if we express genuine interest in those around us and ask God to open a door to share our faith, He will answer that prayer.
We tend to be motivated by temporal activities that eventually fade away. But souls are forever, and people need to know the Savior. Look for opportunities to reach out to those around you—strike up a conversation; ask how they’re doing. Be on the lookout for the chance to share the love of Christ.
