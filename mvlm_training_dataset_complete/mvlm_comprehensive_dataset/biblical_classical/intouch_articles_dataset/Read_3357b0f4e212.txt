Salvation happens in an instant, but understanding it takes a lifetime.
The moment we trust Jesus as Lord and Savior, we enter into a life of faith. In other words, we live by the assurance that God is who He says and will do everything He promises. Salvation is instantaneous, but it takes a lifetime to learn and grow as believers.
As soon as we are saved, God begins what is known as sanctification, teaching us to be like Him. This is a process. As was true of Abraham, it takes time for us to understand how to walk by faith, trusting in what we cannot see.
To grow in godliness, we must learn to listen to and obey our Father. We must choose daily to follow His way. But this is not a natural tendency, so self-discipline is needed. It is helpful to set a regular time to meditate upon God’s Word. Eagerly expect Jesus to speak to you, and listen to what He is saying. Write notes in your Bible or a journal, with the date and what the Lord has impressed upon you. Then apply the truth you learn and observe the results.
Hearing God’s voice and being in tune with His Spirit are vital parts of walking in faith. But these things don’t just happen; they require persistence (Hebrews 10:36). As with physical exercise, the more we strengthen our spiritual “muscles,” the more the process becomes part of who we are.
