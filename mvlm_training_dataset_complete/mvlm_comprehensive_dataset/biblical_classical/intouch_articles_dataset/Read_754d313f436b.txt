Doubting God’s Goodness
When you face temptation, remember that sin leads to suffering but trusting God leads to blessing.
Living in this fallen world can challenge our faith in God’s goodness. The pain and suffering that resulted from Adam and Eve’s sin may cloud our understanding of the Lord. Why doesn’t He always relieve hardships, fix our problems, and give us what we want?
When Eve listened to the serpent’s lies in the garden of Eden, she began to doubt God. Why would He deprive her of wisdom and the enjoyment of food that looked so desirable? Our thoughts are similar to Eve’s when we don’t agree with what our Father says is best for us. From a human perspective, “good” refers to what is enjoyable, comfortable, or profitable. But the Lord has a much higher standard and is always working to achieve His purpose—to develop Christlike character in His children.
Behind every restriction or commandment our Father gives to us is His loving care for His children. He knows the consequences of sin and wants to protect us.
Adam and Eve learned through disobedience that God knows what’s best. We have the opportunity each day to discover His goodness by listening to His voice, obeying His commands, and trusting His wisdom. Whatever may come our way, we can know He is working for both our temporal and eternal good (Romans 8:28).
