To avoid error and understand the truth of Scripture, we must read verses in context.
When studying a Bible verse, it’s important to consider the surrounding scriptures. Without understanding the context, we might get the wrong idea.
Psalm 37 is a great example. In verse 4, David writes that God “will give you the desires of your heart.” By itself, this phrase makes the Lord sound like a genie. The full verse, however, reveals that our desires are met when we delight ourselves in the Lord. What this means is, when we take pleasure in spending time with the Father—learning what pleases Him and praying for discernment—our heart aligns with His.
In verse 5 of the same psalm, we’re promised the desires of our heart again when we commit our way to the Lord. Then in verse 7, David writes, “Rest in the Lord and wait patiently for Him.” The kind of desires David is referring to come from a heart committed to God and His perfect timing. Jesus confirmed this truth when He promised, “Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided to you” (Matthew 6:33).
In the broader context, we see that God is not a source of instant gratification, but instead—and even better—He is a wise and loving Father. The full, true picture of Scripture is always the best one.
