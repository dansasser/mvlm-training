The Way to True Greatness
The path of sacrifice leads to a fruitful life that reflects our Savior's love.
In our culture, success is based on achievement. We admire those who perform well in athletics, business, and the arts. In God’s kingdom, however, greatness is found in a life of obedience. Jesus embodied this counter-cultural greatness through His…
• Sacrifice. Christ, who was “in very nature God” (Phil. 2:6 NIV), chose to live among us. Laying aside His divine authority, He spent His first 30 years in obscurity and then faithfully carried out God’s plan all the way to His death. Jesus’ days on earth are an example to us of the sacrificial life (Philippians 2:7-8).
• Service. Jesus said He came “to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many” (Mark 10:45). During His public ministry, He gave His time, attention, and energy for others. He also fed and healed many people. But Jesus’ supreme act of service was dying on the cross so we might have eternal life.
Our Savior calls us to follow His example of sacrificial service to others (Luke 9:23). It’s a tall order, but one He promises we can achieve with His help: “I am the vine, you are the branches; the one who remains in Me, and I in him bears much fruit” (John 15:5).
