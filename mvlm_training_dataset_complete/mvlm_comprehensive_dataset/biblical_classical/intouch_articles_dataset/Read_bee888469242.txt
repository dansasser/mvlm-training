Listening With Humility
Wise people pause to consider advice from others; the foolish ignore warnings of danger ahead.
Let’s return to yesterday’s scene.  When David saw Abigail kneeling in the road, he could have ordered her out of his path. After all, he was powerful. He had been anointed to be the king of Israel and had an entire army behind him. Nothing obligated him to stop and hear what Abigail had to say—but thankfully, he did.
Have you ever been barreling toward a huge mistake, only to hear someone caution you? Did you consider what the person was saying? And would you say things turned out better as a result? Or perhaps the opposite has been the case and you ignored wise advice—if so, it’s highly likely you learned a great deal from that experience!
Abigail’s words were wise and persuasive, and David prudently chose to listen with humility. His decision to heed the woman’s pleas diverted him from a course that would have tainted his future rule.
If you’re facing a decision today, God doesn’t expect you to figure it out on your own. Maybe the Holy Spirit is providing counsel (John 14:26), or it might be that God has sent someone to advise you. Who is the Abigail in your path? May you have the wisdom to listen to those God has placed in front of you.
