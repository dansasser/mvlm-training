Are you restless and yearning for something you can't identify? Spend time with God.
In a posthumously published work called Pensées (the French word for “thoughts”), religious philosopher and mathematician Blaise Pascal discussed the hunger mankind feels that can’t be satisfied by human effort. The passage is well worth reading, so let’s take a look at it together.
Pascal wrote: “What else does this craving, and this helplessness, proclaim but that there was once in man a true happiness, of which all that now remains is the empty print and trace? This he tries in vain to fill with everything around him ... though none can help, since this infinite abyss can be filled only with an infinite and immutable object; in other words, by God himself.”
There’s a reason why life feels empty: God created us with a yearning—one that He alone can satisfy. We can’t be fulfilled until we experience the Lord’s transforming and unconditional love. Jesus said, “I came so that they would have life, and have it abundantly” (John 10:10). In other words, God wants us to feel complete, but that can happen only through a relationship with Him.
We can know joy and contentment when we seek God above all else. Pray for His guidance, and ask Him to fill your life as only He can (Psalms 63:1-5).
