When scary challenges come, ask your heavenly Father for help.
Yesterday, we looked at how Elijah boldly challenged the prophets of Baal. Today’s passage focuses on King Jehoshaphat, who learned an army was coming, sought God for direction and strength, and then called upon the nation to do likewise. Their examples teach what is required for prayer to be powerful:
Dependence on God. Their petitions showed deep reliance upon the Lord. Knowing that victory was beyond their own abilities, they asked God to intervene.
A focus on His plan. Elijah did things God’s way against tremendous odds and at great personal risk (1 Kings 19:1-2). Jehoshaphat called for the nation to fast as he sought the Lord’s plan. Because they looked to God for a strategy, both men had a clear goal that led them through the difficulties they faced.
Purity of motive. The two leaders had God-centered intentions and a goal of furthering His purposes.
Confidence in God’s faithfulness. Neither man hesitated to ask publicly for divine help. Elijah called on God to test the 450 enemy prophets, and Jehoshaphat instructed all of Israel to pray.
If your prayers seem to be having little impact, ask the Lord to help you follow the examples of Elijah and Jehoshaphat—and be ready for His answer.
