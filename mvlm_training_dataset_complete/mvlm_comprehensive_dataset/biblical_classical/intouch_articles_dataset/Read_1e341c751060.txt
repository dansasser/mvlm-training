Our Father wants us to realize that we can ask for what we need and trust Him to care for us.
Throughout the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus had been teaching the crowd how to walk with Him—to be pure in heart, to have mercy, to turn the other cheek (Matthew 5:1-48; Matthew 6:1-34). Imagine Him looking around at each person whom He loved so very much. He must have known every laugh line, wrinkle, and scar on their eager faces. Even more amazingly, He also knew their hopes and dreams, their fears and doubts. And so He concluded His revolutionary sermon by saying, “Ask, and it will be given to you” (7:7).  But did they—and do we—really understand what that means?
Asking the Father for anything requires faith—not only in His capacity to meet our needs but also in His desire to do so. That’s why Jesus reassured His listeners with visible, tangible examples of a fish, snake, loaf, and stone (vv. 9-10). If we want nothing more than to give good things to our loved ones, He says, we can trust that God in His perfect love desires to give us even greater blessings.
When Jesus tells us to ask, He affirms our identity as beloved children. He’s more than able and willing to meet our needs; our part is believing we are loved enough to make a request. Whatever you need today, ask with confidence and thanksgiving, knowing that your prayer will be answered in whatever way He deems best.
