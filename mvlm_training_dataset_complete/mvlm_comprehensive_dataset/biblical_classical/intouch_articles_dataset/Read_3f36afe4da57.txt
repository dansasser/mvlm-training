The God of the universe offers constant love and care to all who trust Him.
When you feel fear begin to rise, how do you typically respond? The next time you face anxiety, pause to ask yourself the following questions: Has God ever failed me in the past? Does He promise to meet all of my needs? Does He keep His promises?
If we read the Bible, we’ll find countless stories of God’s faithfulness. For example, the apostle Paul lived through persecution, pain, and all kinds of terrible circumstances, yet he was able to make the bold declaration that God weaves it all together for the good of His followers (Romans 8:28). This testifies to the fact that for those who trust in Him, God turns every difficulty, loss, and separation into something beneficial.
Whatever we read in Scripture—whether it’s a story about Abraham, Sarah, Job, Hannah, David, Isaiah, Jonah, John, Paul, or others—we see God’s constant love and care for His people. His Word is a lamp that will give us clear guidance when circumstances are bleak. It offers the best direction we’ll ever find. When we meditate upon it, pray over it, grapple with it, and incorporate it into our life, His light chases away the darkness.
God, the sovereign ruler of this universe, is in control of your life. When you read your Bible and meditate on it, you will find genuine strength in His promises.
