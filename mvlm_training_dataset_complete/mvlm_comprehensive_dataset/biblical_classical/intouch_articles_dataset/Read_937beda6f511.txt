Humble people recognize that each individual has great worth in God's eyes.
The Lord has specific aims for each of us individually. But He also has goals that apply universally to all believers, such as a relentless, lifelong pursuit of humility.
A humble mindset is more than a healthy view of ourselves; it is a servant’s attitude that acknowledges our total dependence on the Lord. Philippians 2:3 says, “Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves.” In order of priority, Jesus comes first, others are second, and we are last.
As believers, we speak emphatically about loving others, forgiving them unconditionally, and treating them with kindness. But the root of these actions is humility. To be able to love and forgive others, we must be willing to recognize their great worth in God’s eyes and the magnitude of His compassion, love, and forgiveness toward mankind. As Ephesians 4:32 says, “Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.”
If we think only of how we feel, what’s convenient for us, or ways to profit from a situation, we won’t be demonstrating Jesus’ love. However, when humility is our goal, then love, forgiveness, and kindness will grow out of it.
