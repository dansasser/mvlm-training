Perseverance in Prayer
To find God’s peace and joy, determine to trust Him—no matter how He answers your requests.
Are you satisfied with your prayer life? Yesterday, we began looking at obstacles to vibrant communication with the Lord. Today, let’s explore one more hindrance: impatience.
Most of us have at some point brought fervent supplication to Jesus but did not see the desired results. We must remember that God isn’t at our beck and call like some cosmic bellhop. But it’s encouraging to realize that if we could see the big picture as He can, we’d gladly wait for His way and timing.
The truth is, we benefit by not receiving all that we request. To understand this concept is a sign of spiritual maturity. When we are thoroughly satisfied with the Lord’s presence (Psalm 16:11), our relationship with Him will flourish, even when we don’t get everything we ask for. When that’s the case, we grasp what prayer is—not a long list of wants but regular communication in a relationship.
Barriers can develop if we persistently cry out to God and nothing changes. But by continuing to pray, we’ll sense God’s presence and will find peace, joy, and awesome glimpses of His glory. This will be completely satisfying, even if He never gives exactly what was requested.
