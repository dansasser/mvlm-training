Our Relationship With God
Bible study, prayer, and obedience are habits that help us maintain a healthy connection to God.
By trusting in Christ, we enter into a lifelong relationship with the Father. As believers, we have a responsibility to keep that connection healthy.
First, we must learn about our new family. In the Bible, God gave a detailed description of His attributes and values. And through Jesus’ earthly life, we can better understand His Father’s divine character.
Second, we should stay in close contact with the Lord through prayer and study of His Word. It’s important that we resist the temptation to put people, work, or pleasure ahead of Him.
Third, we must respond to what God has communicated to us. He’s given instructions for living and explained what pleases Him. In healthy families, people pay attention to each other.
Finally, we’re to grow stronger in our likeness to God. As we cooperate with the transforming work of the Holy Spirit, we will start to think and act like our heavenly Father.
God the Father provided salvation through His Son, who died so we could become spiritually alive. Jesus set an example for us to follow: a life of loving, obedient service.
God’s Spirit is doing His sanctifying work in us (1 Peter 1:2). Are we doing our part to keep the relationship healthy?
