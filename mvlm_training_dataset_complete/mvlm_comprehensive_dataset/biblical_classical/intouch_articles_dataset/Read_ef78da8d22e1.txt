The Damage of Prayerlessness
Believers committed to prayer and Bible study find relief from the weight of life's burdens.
Prayer should be a priority for anyone who wants to be used mightily by God. Jesus often slipped away to spend quiet moments with His Father (Matthew 14:22-23). If He needed prayer time, then we surely can’t live well without it! Yesterday we saw that those who “go it alone” become weary from bearing unnecessary burdens.
Carrying that extra weight has other serious results as well. When drained spiritually, emotionally, or physically, we’re more susceptible to discouragement. Without spending time in prayer and study, believers enter a cycle where troubles loom ever larger as man-made solutions fail. Under such conditions, becoming disheartened is unavoidable.
Loss of confidence is soon followed by doubt. Someone who questions God’s faithfulness will seek refuge everywhere except in prayer and Scripture. But a believer immersed in these things will find security in God’s power and presence.
Forsaking prayer leads to negative outcomes. But that can be reversed at any time: Confess your prayerlessness and prioritize regular quiet time with God. He’s waiting for you with open arms, ready to make your burdens light (Matthew 11:28-30), offer encouragement, and fill your heart with confidence.
