Let the Spirit Guide Your Thinking
For a better tomorrow, surrender to the leading of the Holy Spirit today.
The way we think determines how we behave. If we want to conquer our sinful tendencies, we must learn to see ourselves as God sees us—new creations no longer under the mastery of sin. Because of the presence of Christ’s Spirit, we have the capacity to be “more than conquerors” (Rom. 8:37 NKJV).
All who trust in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior receive the gift of the Helper—God’s Holy Spirit (John 14:26). As we place ourselves under His control, He releases divine power into our life. To be Spirit-led also requires diligence on our part, both to resist temptation and to maintain our surrendered state.
For us to become conquerors, we should regularly spend time with the Lord and focus our mind on spiritual things (Philippians 4:8). In that way, we’ll learn to discern God’s will so we can choose what’s suitable (Matthew 5:3-11) and reject what’s ungodly (Galatians 5:19-21). The longer we are led by the Spirit, the more sensitive we’ll be to His warnings about temptation and the greater our ability to follow and obey Him.
As we close out 2024, give yourself a gift: Surrender to the Lord and experience the victories He gives to those who are Spirit-filled.
