Understanding Jesus’ Sacrifice
In order to give us His righteousness, the perfect Savior willingly chose to bear the consequences of our sin.
In the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus repeatedly prayed that “this cup” would pass from Him (Matt. 26:39-44). Christ was staring into a cup of wrath, sin, and judgment that must have made His soul recoil (Isaiah 51:17). According to Scripture, Jesus didn’t just die for our sin; He became our sin (2 Corinthians 5:21). The holy, perfect Lamb of God took on Himself all that was vile and dark—and He understood the consequences of taking on our sin.
Jesus had always enjoyed perfect oneness with the Father. But God’s holiness was incompatible with the presence of sin, which is why Jesus felt “forsaken” on the cross (Matthew 27:46). There was never any question about whether He’d obey His Father’s will—the Son would become sin and experience the punishment for it if that’s what was required to save us. So, yes, in the garden, He pleaded for another route to our redemption. However, when the Father made clear there was no other way, Jesus obediently—and lovingly—gave Himself up for humanity.
Jesus Christ sacrificed more than His life. He exchanged perfection for punishment. Our Savior did this so we could be transformed into righteous men and women with an eternal future. No wonder all of heaven exalts Him. And we should as well!
