Praise the Lord for the many ways He has and will continue to provide for you.
When we place our trust in God, we can be assured that He provides for all our needs. Here are a few of our most cherished blessings from the Lord:
Forgiveness. When you place your trust in Jesus, your sin is washed away. This refers not only to all previous sin but also to the sin you have not yet committed (Ephesians 1:7).
Freedom. Christianity offers liberation from works-based righteousness. This means that we do not have to earn the Lord’s favor. He loves us perfectly and has made provision for our complete salvation through His Son. All we have to do is accept this loving gift of grace (John 8:36).
Union with God. We don’t worship a distant deity; rather, we praise a loving Father who knows every detail of our life. Scripture reveals that we are “sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit” (Ephesians 1:13). This means we are forever joined to the Father.
Eternal life. If you have been sealed in God, then you are forever bound with Him. He has you firmly in His grip, and nothing can pull you away (John 10:28-29).
God gives us so many good things to enjoy, but we’re never meant to find our security in them. Today, thank Him for the many ways He has and will continue to provide for you.
