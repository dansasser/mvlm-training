Salvation isn't something we earn; it is a gift of God.
Today’s passage tells us that we have been saved by grace through faith. Whatever we’re asked to change or give up for Jesus’ sake pales in comparison with that amazing gift.
The Lord isn’t looking for people who change a few habits by sheer force of will; He’s calling people to surrender themselves to Him. The only action God requires is belief in Him. That means trusting Jesus is who He says He is, will do what He promises, has the authority to forgive, and will equip His people to live a godly life. Because of those convictions, a new Christian is empowered to turn away from his or her old life—in other words, to repent—and begin the process of living as “a new creature” (2 Corinthians 5:17).
We don’t evolve into a saved people by stopping old habits and instituting better religious ones. Rather, we are transformed by the saving power of Jesus Christ when we believe in Him.
Since salvation isn’t something we earn, no one can boast before God. Compared with the holiness of Jesus Christ, all of our moral living, good deeds, and strenuous efforts to change bad habits amount to nothing (Isaiah 64:6). Only His righteousness can cover our sins and make us right before the Father.
