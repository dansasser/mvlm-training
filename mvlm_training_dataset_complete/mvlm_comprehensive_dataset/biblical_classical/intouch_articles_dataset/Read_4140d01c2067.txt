How do you respond when facing challenges?
Storms are inevitable. In nature, powerful tempests leave a changed landscape behind them. Similarly, challenging circumstances can alter the topography of our life.
When difficulties arise, how do you respond? Do you say to the Lord, “I am doing what You asked, so why is this happening?” Such thinking assumes that being in the center of God’s will exempts us from problems. In Matthew 14, we learn that Jesus instructed the disciples to get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the opposite shore. While they were obeying Him, high winds and waves developed. Storms can arise even when we are exactly where God wants us to be (John 16:33).
Another question we sometimes ask is, “Father, what have I done wrong?” God does use trials to correct us, but not all situations come from our mistakes. He may allow troubles to perfect us—that is, to mature us and grow us into Christ’s likeness.
God uses different things to train and equip us, because He wants each of His children to become a strong, vital servant of the Lord Jesus Christ. Realize that nothing can happen to a believer unless God allows it. Instead of keeping our head bent low against the struggles of life, let’s look up to the Lord and seek His purposes in our challenges.
