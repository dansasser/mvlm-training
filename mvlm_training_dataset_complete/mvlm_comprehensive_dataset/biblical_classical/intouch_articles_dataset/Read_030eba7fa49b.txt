God’s Provisions in Adversity
Are you struggling right now? Look for reasons to express genuine gratitude to the Lord.
1 Thessalonians 5:16-18
1 Thessalonians 5:16-18
Yesterday, we looked at three provisions believers can count on during adversity: God’s presence, a pathway through trouble, and potential to grow. Today, let’s explore two more.
Protection. God doesn’t necessarily keep believers from distress or disappointment. Stopping the storms may be our goal, but from His point of view, the adversity may be necessary to mature us spiritually. However, the Father offers protection by staying with us in the struggle. What’s more, we have assurance that nothing can separate us from His love (Romans 8:38-39). So our ever-present God walks with us through the hardships, providing guidance and speaking truth into the situation.
Peace. While difficulties cause many people anxiety, God’s peace is available to us. This serenity does not depend on whether circumstances improve. Rather, it’s a result of our relationship with Him. Our main focus shouldn’t be on fixing the problem; rather, we should seek and trust the Lord.
As we recognize the Lord’s provision during trials, we can genuinely express gratitude. Doing so will enable us to fix our eyes on Him rather than on our circumstance. While we often aren’t aware of the purpose for each trial facing us, we do know that God is trustworthy and good—and He won’t waste our suffering.
