To influence the next generation for Christ, we need to give children our time, attention, and love.
From a young age, children observe the grownups in their life. What an opportunity for adults to influence the next generation! And some good ways to train young ones in godliness are by …
Investing time in their life. Whether it’s reading, talking, or being together outdoors, we can model Christian living through everyday activities.
Listening closely to them. To influence children toward righteousness, we must truly know them and take an interest in the things they consider important.
Protecting children through discipline. When done with love, discipline helps them understand the wisdom of God’s boundaries and the importance of self-control. (See Hebrews 12:6.)
Admitting our mistakes. Transparency helps children draw closer to parents. It also teaches them humility. If we seem perfect, our kids will find it harder to confess their mistakes to us.
Loving them unconditionally. We should consistently love our children, just as Christ loves us.
Raising a godly child often involves the cooperation of many people. Look for ways to spend time with the children in your life, listen well to them, and demonstrate Christ’s love (Matthew 19:14). By modeling godliness, you’ll influence them for the Lord.
