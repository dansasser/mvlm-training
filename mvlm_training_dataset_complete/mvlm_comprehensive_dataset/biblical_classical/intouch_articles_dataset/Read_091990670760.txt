Accountability Is Scriptural
God planned for us to need each other; we truly are better together.
The Bible has a lot to say about accountability. But for many of us, the idea of sharing personal information feels uncomfortable and seems like an invasion of privacy. Being answerable to someone else seems like a hindrance to the pursuit of pleasure, prosperity, and prestige. Most of us would rather keep to ourselves and not involve others in our business.
The Bible, however, makes it clear that Christians are to support each other in this regard: “Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed” (James 5:16). Accountability in the body of Christ is a biblical principle. Church members take direction from their pastor (Hebrews 13:17). Paul tells us to be subject to one another (Ephesians 5:21). He reported to the church (Acts 14:27), and Timothy was subordinate to him (1 Timothy 4:13-16). The apostles were under the authority of Jesus (Luke 10:1-42), even as Jesus was subject to the Father (John 8:28-29). Of course, the Bible tells us that the whole church is obedient to the Lord Jesus Christ (Ephesians 5:24).
Regardless of one’s position, everybody is accountable to somebody. And this holds true for the entire family of faith—from the congregation to the ministers to Jesus Himself, who served God the Father.
