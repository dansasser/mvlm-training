Jesus came to earth as a man so that we can know God—not just know about Him.
Believers understand that Jesus is God’s Son, but we should also know His mission, how He fulfilled it, and the significance for our life. Christ had a twofold goal in coming to earth: to provide us with a tangible image of who God is, and to die for our sin.
What an incredible plan! The omnipotent, omniscient Lord had existed since eternity past (John 1:1; John 8:58). Yet He set aside the power and strength that were rightly His in order to become like us. Since Jesus—God in human flesh—lived His life alongside men, we are better able to understand our heavenly Father (Colossians 1:15).
Through Christ’s sacrifice, we are invited into an eternal relationship with God. Scripture teaches that we all have sinned (Isaiah 53:6; Romans 3:23), and to pay for our sin, a perfect sacrifice was needed (Romans 6:23; Deuteronomy 17:1). The Savior, who was both fully God and fully man, died to rescue us. He is the only one who could lay down His life and bridge the gap between humanity and the eternal Father.
There is no possible way for us to earn our salvation. It is an awesome gift that God freely offers to each of us. The only requirement is that we receive Jesus Christ as our Savior and follow Him.
