God Redeems Our Losses
Because of the cross, we have sure hope for a better tomorrow.
The book of Ruth begins with death: Naomi loses her husband and sons, and her daughters-in-law Ruth and Orpah are widowed. Though Ruth is a Moabite who could easily return to her family of origin, she chooses to stay with her mother-in-law, adopting Naomi’s faith in God as her own.
Ruth and Naomi go to Bethlehem, the older woman’s hometown, where faith in God’s provision leads Ruth to a barley field as a gleaner. In a story only God could write, the owner of the field is Boaz—Naomi’s relative who can restore the family line. Through this “kinsman-redeemer,” God displays His remarkable power to provide.
This can be true for us as well, even when our life looks far different than the one we envisioned. Though the book of Ruth begins with death, it ends in life, through the birth of her son Obed.
Ruth’s story teaches us that even if we experience loss, God is faithful to refashion our circumstances into a new story that sings of His lovingkindness. He can redeem all things—even death. Centuries later, another descendant of Ruth and Boaz would be born in Bethlehem: Jesus, who rescued us from the grave by giving His life on the cross.
