Our Financial Security
Trust God to provide all you need—then the joy of lavish generosity can be yours.
Sharing is a learned behavior; generosity simply isn’t a natural characteristic. Look at young children. They squabble over who goes first, whose piece of cookie is bigger, and who plays with which toys and for how long. As adults, we struggle as well, especially when it comes to our finances. The choices we make with our money—how much we hold, how much and how often we give—reveal where we truly place our trust.
The Lord calls His followers to a lifestyle of generous giving (Luke 6:38), not of accumulating and hoarding. He tells us to find security in our relationship with Him rather than in our assets (Matthew 7:24-26). Why? Because for most of us, no matter how much we have, it simply never feels like enough.
Also, when we focus on money, we open the door to uncertainty and anxiety. What if we lose our job? Miss the promotion? Get a long-term illness? Witness a stock market decline? When our finances suffer, we feel insecure. But if our security is in our relationship with Christ, then we’ll be thankful for what we have and will trust Him for the future.
Finances are given to us by the Lord to be used for His purposes, not ours. By keeping a right perspective on wealth, we can experience God’s peace in a true and tangible way.
