God's will may not always be easy, but it's always best for us.
1 Corinthians 6:19-20
1 Corinthians 6:19-20
As we saw yesterday, God wants us to surrender our life to Him. But perhaps you have wondered why the Lord asks this of us.
First, Scripture teaches that He’s the sovereign King who rules over the entire universe (Nehemiah 9:6) and, as a result, we are under His divine authority. Next, through His death and resurrection, Jesus saved us from our sin, bringing us from death to life. And finally, He sustains us—so we should consider each breath and heartbeat to be a gift from Him.
The Lord desires that we yield our life to His will. He loves His children “with an everlasting love” (Jeremiah 31:3) and has good plans for each one of us. The Father promises that following Him leads to hope and an established future—as Psalm 31:19 states, “How great is Your goodness, which You have stored up for those who fear You.” So, while He is the Almighty with authority over every aspect of our life, He also promises to care for us and bring good from every situation.
Are you willing to follow Jesus? His way is best, and it offers hope, joy, and peace. And, while some of His decisions may not be to our liking, we must believe in His promise to work all things for our good. Will you trust God enough to hand the reins over to Him?
