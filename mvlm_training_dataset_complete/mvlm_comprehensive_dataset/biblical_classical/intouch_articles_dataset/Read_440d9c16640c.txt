Self-Inflicted Adversity
Don't be discouraged by the Lord's discipline—it comes because He loves and delights in you.
The difficulties we face come from one of three sources. Some are sent to us by the Lord to test our faith, others are the result of Satan’s attacks, and still others are due to our own sinful choices. Which of these three causes is the hardest for you to bear?
Most of us would probably say the last one, because we have nobody to blame but ourselves. After all, the Word of God says we will reap what we have sown (Galatians 6:7), so we see nothing ahead except a painful harvest. This kind of thinking fails to take into account the Lord’s redemptive abilities. He never promises to remove all the consequences of sin, but He can use our failures to teach us to fear and obey Him.
God often uses our own mistakes as tools to get our attention. He won’t let His beloved children get away with sin, because He knows that would rob us of blessings, opportunities, and character refinement.
As painful as your situation may be, express gratitude to your heavenly Father for caring enough to send His loving discipline. Now it’s up to you. How will you respond to His correction? When we learn from experience, the scars of sin can lead us to restoration and a renewed intimacy with God.
