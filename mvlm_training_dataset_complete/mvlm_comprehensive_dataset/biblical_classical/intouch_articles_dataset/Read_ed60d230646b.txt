Will you choose to lay down your burden and believe what God says about you?
For us as believers, false guilt can be an unbearable weight. The nagging sense of shame can lead to doubting the Lord’s love and goodness; we might even start to wonder if our salvation is real. Thankfully, though, God wants us to know relief from that burden.
First of all, it’s helpful to identify the root cause of our guilt. (Check yesterday’s devotion for a description of some potential causes.) Next, we must affirm three truths:
• I am special. Any reason we give to “prove” otherwise is a lie from Satan. We are each a one-of-a-kind creation. The Lord chose to endow us with specific talents and abilities meant to be used for His kingdom and His glory (1 Corinthians 12:28; Ephesians 4:11-12).
• I am loved. Because the Father wanted us to live with Him eternally, He sent His Son to die for our sins. We don’t have to do anything to earn God’s love; it is already ours for the receiving.
• I am forgiven. If we confess our sins, the Lord forgives. The Bible promises the process is as simple as that.
Since it’s Satan who creates feelings of false guilt, the final step is to renounce his lies. Make a declaration: “In the name of Jesus, I reject these feelings of guilt. They have no scriptural basis. They are false, and I refuse to acknowledge them.” The result will be that the heavy weight of guilt lifts from the heart.
