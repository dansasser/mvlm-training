The Soundtrack of Complaint
Are you enduring a dark night of the soul? Hang on—a beautiful morning is coming.
Many of us have a quiet soundtrack running through our mind, and the volume is turned down so low we can barely hear it. But the songs are old familiar ones with titles like “Slow Cashier Blues,” “I Just Got Cut Off in Traffic,” and “My Delivery Was Delayed … Again.” Grumbling about the irritations and annoyances of everyday life can become an unconscious habit—at least until we try to turn it off.
In 2 Timothy 3:1-5, Paul lists a string of behaviors that mark the life of those who have disconnected from the Lord. In addition to things like selfishness, arrogance, and greed, that list also includes ungratefulness. Being grateful helps us learn to change the station away from that soundtrack of complaint and instead teaches us to focus on the many blessings God gives each day, both big and small.
Gratitude doesn’t mean plastering a big smile on your face and pretending that an aggravating situation is no big deal. Instead, our thankfulness reconnects us with God in the midst of the everyday challenges of life and teaches us to sing a new song—one that will continue for all of eternity.
