Discovering God’s Path
The Lord wants to show you His will—do you want to know what it is?
Perhaps you have wondered, Does God have a specific plan for my life? And if He does, is it possible to know what the plan is? These are questions many Christians have grappled with at some point. And there’s good news—the answer to both is a resounding yes! God has a plan for each believer’s life. Moreover, He wants us to know and walk the path He has for us.
Sometimes we make the idea of finding the Lord’s will more complicated than it needs to be. He’s not playing hide and seek with His will. There are three simple things we can do to discover His best path for our life:
We must have a sincere desire for God’s guidance, trusting that He will direct us in His perfect timing (John 16:13).
We should seek the Lord through His Word. After all, the Bible is one of the primary tools He uses to make His will and His ways apparent to us (2 Timothy 3:16-17).
We are to pray continually (1 Thessalonians 5:17), fully expecting that our Father has something to say to us, His beloved children.
As we seek the Lord in these ways, we’ll be able to perceive His direction for our life. Then, we can live with the confident hope that we are walking in His will.
