The Cost of Our Salvation
Take a moment today to thank Jesus for His great sacrifice and love.
It’s easy to forget what things cost. This is especially true with sin. The Bible tells us that, for our sake, Jesus suffered ...
Physical pain. Our Savior was mocked, beaten, and humiliated. In His weakened state, He was forced to carry on His shoulders the instrument of His death—the cross. Then He was nailed to it and hoisted up to die. (See John 19:1-30.)
Man’s sin. Jesus lived a perfect life on earth and never knew the disgrace of sin or the bitterness of regret. But at the cross, Christ experienced the fullness of our transgressions, guilt, and shame.
Abandonment. We know of just a handful of Jesus’ followers—including His mother and John—who remained near as He suffered (John 19:25-27). Many were no doubt afraid they would meet the same fate.
Divine judgment. God’s wrath was poured out on Christ because of our sin. He experienced the condemnation that we deserved (Isaiah 53:5-6; Romans 5:9).
Our Savior suffered greatly on our behalf, shedding His blood to afford us the opportunity to become part of God’s family (John 1:12). Take a moment today to tell Him how grateful you are for His sacrifice and love.
