The Holy Spirit intercedes for us and shows us what petitions to bring to the Lord.
Does this sound familiar? Determined to spend more time in prayer, you kneel, open your mouth to speak to the Lord, and—draw a blank. Sure, you manage a few words about what you need Him to do for you and your family, but you should be praying for more than that, right?
Yes, you should. Believers’ needs are indeed the Father’s concern; nothing escapes His notice. However, He tells His children to imitate Jesus—they should “not merely look out for [their] own personal interests, but also for the interests of others” (Philippians 2:4). Selfless prayer likely isn’t natural to us, but thankfully, God has supplied a Helper. The Holy Spirit, our willing and able partner in praying effectively, intercedes for us (Rom. 8:26).
How should we cooperate with the Spirit’s intercession for us? First, we must recognize God’s authority, holiness, and glory. Then, we need to submit to His leadership. Finally, we must entrust our future to Him, believing that He will bring great good out of negative as well as positive events in our life.
In submission to the Holy Spirit, we’ll discover greater peace and joy. And as we bring petitions inspired by the Spirit, we’ll also find new words for praying to the Father. Even more importantly, we will develop a deeper understanding of God’s greatness.
