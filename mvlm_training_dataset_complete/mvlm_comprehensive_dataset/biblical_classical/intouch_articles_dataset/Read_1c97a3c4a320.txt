The Key to Surviving Tough Times
To receive God’s intended blessing, focus your attention on Him during trials.
In today’s passage, we read how Moses endured difficulties: by faith. We all will face trying moments. The key is to remember that tough times are …
Inescapable. “For man is born for trouble, as sparks fly upward” (Job 5:7). We all will experience periods when life is hard. Therefore, it is essential that we learn to respond in the way God desires.
Able to destroy or develop us. Have you ever noticed how differently people respond to the same challenging situation? Some grow more focused while others fall apart or are even destroyed by the trial. The way we respond depends on our perspective—namely, are we God-centered or trial-centered?
Survivable. The key is to learn how to walk in continual awareness of God’s presence. Moses demonstrated this in seeking to free the Israelite people from Egyptian slavery. He had learned to “see” our invisible God walking by his side and to be constantly mindful of His presence (Exodus 33:13-14).
How aware are you of the Lord’s presence? Are your fears receding as you consciously believe in His protection and sufficiency? Moses did not start out with this awareness. He had to learn and develop it—and so do we.
