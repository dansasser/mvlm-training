Joy in the Holy Spirit
Abiding with our Lord brings gifts that money can't buy.
In today’s passage, the apostle Paul writes, “[Do not] put an obstacle or a stumbling block in a brother’s or sister’s way … For if because of food your brother or sister is hurt, you are no longer walking in accordance with love” (vv. 13, 15). God’s kingdom isn’t about what we eat or drink—or any other “rule” we think we must follow. Rather, it’s about the transformative work of the Holy Spirit within us.
When we align with God’s righteousness, seeking His ways and His will, joy blossoms. The Holy Spirit, our Comforter and Guide, brings it to life within us. He reminds us of God’s love, assures us of our salvation, and empowers us to live in harmony with those around us. This is not some superficial or temporary happiness; it’s the fruit of the Spirit dwelling in us (Galatians 5:22) and transcends our circumstances.
Take a moment to reflect on the joy that comes from knowing God and seeking Him. This profound sense of stability and strength cannot be bought or manufactured—it flows from our connection to the Source of all joy and is a taste of the eternal pleasures that await us in God’s presence (Psalm 16:11).
