The Blessings of Godly Friendship
We should build up fellow believers and encourage them to be more like Christ.
In all of God’s creation, just one thing did not meet with His approval. He beheld Adam and said, “It is not good for the man to be alone” (Genesis 2:18). The Creator designed us for emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual closeness.
Jesus explained this to His disciples, saying they should love each other as He had loved them. In a God-honoring friendship, two people build each other up and spur one another on toward Christlikeness. Many people, however, fall far short of making and maintaining connections that sharpen their faith (Proverbs 27:17).
In fact, the walls we build to keep people at a distance are often defenses against God as well: Many don’t want Him too close to their most personal business. But in learning to share freely with a brother or sister in Christ, believers will likely develop the capacity to be more honest with God as well. Then their own maturing faith can be a stimulus for the faith of others to grow.
Strong relationships begin with men and women who decide to risk their pride and comfort in order to love like Jesus. They recognize one reason we have friends is so we can motivate one another toward holiness. In a friendship of mutual trust and submission, two people will confess sin, offer gentle reproof, and share burdens. That kind of vulnerability brings rich rewards.
