Revealing the Hidden King
All Christians are called to tell others that the Messiah has come.
When Jesus was born, His mother knew His identity—and she treasured the things she knew about Him, “pondering them in her heart” (Luke 2:19). It wasn’t until He became a public figure at age 30 that Jesus began to fulfill some of what she already believed to be true.
Strangely, He continued to fly under the radar for a while, operating in obscurity or on the margins. It created some frustration for His followers who believed He was the Messiah, the prophesied king of Israel. But there is a gospel theme known as the “messianic secret,” which refers to the times Jesus performed a miracle and said not to tell anyone about it. (See Mark 8:30.)
The great mystery of God becoming man was that Israel’s king was coming, but incognito. Even during the last week of His life, when the marks of His ministry took on a fully messianic character, Jesus was still holding off on the full explanation of who He was.
The irony of all this secrecy, though, was that those who met Jesus told everyone about Him. And the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20) makes that the norm for all Christians. Because we have experienced the salvation and freedom that comes from trusting Jesus, we’re called to tell everyone the now-known secret that the King has come and is coming again.
