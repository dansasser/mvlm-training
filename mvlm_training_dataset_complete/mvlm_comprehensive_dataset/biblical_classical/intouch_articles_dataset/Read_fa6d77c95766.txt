All of our wrongs—past, present, and future—are forgiven when we accept the gift Jesus died to give us.
God’s grace has no limits. His mercy can reach the darkest part of our heart. Christ not only erased our past, present, and future sin; He also paid for the wrongs of every generation. When the ancient Israelites brought a goat or a lamb to the temple for a sacrifice, they placed their hands on its head and confessed their sins. The priest then killed the animal and sprinkled some of its blood on the altar of atonement. The ritual symbolized a confessor’s payment for sin.
But the lamb could not actually take on the sin and die in place of the Israelite (Heb. 10:4). If an animal’s blood could actually erase a sin debt, then Jesus’ death would have been unnecessary. The ritual of sacrificing a lamb was the Father’s idea (Leviticus 4:1-35), though the act itself was symbolic. God established such offerings as an illustration of the seriousness of sin. The practice also pointed to Christ’s perfect sacrificial death on our behalf and the salvation He brings.
Like the Israelites, we must also look to a lamb—the Lamb of God (John 1:29). When we receive Jesus’ sacrifice for our sins, we are forgiven forever.
