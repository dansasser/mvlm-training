The Unconditional Love of God
God's love is based on His character—not on our merit.
Have you ever felt that the Lord couldn’t possibly love you? Well, today’s reading clearly tells us that’s not the case. God expresses His love with words, and He has also given us ample proof.
Creation itself is an expression of the awesome way our Father cares for us. He designed earth as the perfect habitation and provides us with the necessities of life. But the highest expression of His love is manifested in His provision for our eternal needs. He sent His Son to redeem us from sin so that we could be forgiven and reconciled to God.
Why, then, do we sometimes doubt His love? Perhaps the reason is that we are looking at it from our own limited perspective: Since human beings struggle to love others unconditionally, we doubt that the Lord can. Or maybe we just feel unworthy. Thankfully, God’s love is based not on whether we are deserving but on His character. We need to understand that love isn’t simply something God does; it’s who He is (1 John 4:8).
Divine love is a demonstration of God’s commitment to our greatest good. In a way, it’s like the ocean tides—you can say, “I don’t believe in waves,” but that won’t stop them from coming. Likewise, nothing you do or feel will stop the Father’s love from washing over you.
