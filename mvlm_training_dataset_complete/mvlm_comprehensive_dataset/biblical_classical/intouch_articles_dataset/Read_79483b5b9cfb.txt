The habit of gratitude protects us from the trap of discontentment and endless striving.
Psalm 23 portrays feasting as a form of trust amid adversity. Imagine the courage it would take to sit down at a banquet with a horde of angry enemies surrounding you. Yet this is God’s invitation to us in every struggle and trial: Come. Sit at My table and rest. I’ve prepared a place for you in the presence of your enemies.
What keeps us from sitting at God’s table and rejoicing in the story of God’s faithfulness in our own life? Three obstacles come to mind: striving, discontentment, and deception. Striving is the internalized sense that we must always keep moving forward in pursuit of success, money, and acclaim. We think, More is always better, and rest is for the weak. This inability to slow down and appreciate God’s gifts breeds a profound sense of unfulfillment, making joy and peace elusive. The world’s competitive striving and restless dissatisfaction are fueled by the enemy’s most ancient and insidious deception: My way is better than God’s way.
But when we feast, we declare that God’s way of gratitude, rest, and simplicity is better than the world’s deceived way of striving and discontentment. We feast to challenge the enemy’s lies. In this way, feasting—slowing down to savor God’s gifts and remember His faithfulness—is an act of spiritual warfare. To feast is to trust in the Lord.
