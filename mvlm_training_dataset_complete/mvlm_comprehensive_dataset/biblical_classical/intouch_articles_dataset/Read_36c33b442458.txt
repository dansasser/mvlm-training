The Bible: God’s Voice Today
If you long for God to speak to you, make time in His Word a habit.
In biblical times, God spoke in many dramatic ways. Although He still speaks today, some of His methods have changed. He doesn’t speak with an audible voice or send an angel every time He has something to say to us.
The primary way our Father speaks to us today is through His written Word. His Holy Spirit breathed divine truth upon the minds of certain men and inspired them perfectly to write it down (2 Tim. 3:16). Not a single thing is missing.
The Bible is God’s way of speaking to our pressing needs, concerns, heartaches, and worries. So often when trouble strikes, we turn to other sources, perhaps talking to a friend or counselor. All of that is well and good, and the Father does indeed speak through godly men and women. But the first resource we should consult is His Word. If you pick up the Bible only when you have a question or emergency in your life, you’ll never get the big picture of what God wants to say to you.
Scripture is a treasure trove of God’s thoughts. Spend time there every day—starting today—mining it for new truths and insights.
