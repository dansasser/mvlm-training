At times gossip may seem harmless, but it has the power to hurt people and cause division.
2 Timothy 2:23-26; 2 Timothy 3:1-5
Gossip is often regarded as a relatively benign practice, especially when compared to “bigger” transgressions like murder or adultery. But in the Bible, God lists gossip alongside these sins (Romans 1:28-31).
Nothing about gossip is harmless. Whether the talk is intentionally cruel or simply some idle musing, the target of the comments can be embarrassed or hurt. Even if the victim never learns of the chitchat going on behind his or her back, gossip still has consequences. The people who spread idle talk to others reveal their inner thinking. In Matthew 12, Jesus says, “For the mouth speaks out of that which fills the heart” (Matthew 12:34). A poisonous tongue is motivated by things like jealousy, resentment, or pride that resides in the heart. Gossip has the power to hurt feelings, destroy reputations and friendships, and divide churches and families.
We should never participate in bringing such damage into anyone’s life. So when we hear gossip, what should we do? God is the only one we should turn to. Ask Him both to protect those being gossiped about and to convict the gossiper. Then commit to praying for and loving everyone involved (Galatians 6:2).
