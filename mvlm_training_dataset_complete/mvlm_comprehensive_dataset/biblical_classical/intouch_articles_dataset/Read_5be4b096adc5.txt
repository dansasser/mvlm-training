The faithful service of committed believers brings untold blessings to those around them.
When you hear the word servant, does anybody spring to mind? Perhaps you recall a helpful repairman or the wonderful woman at work who always takes care of every detail.
Godly servants are all around us, but sadly, we often take them for granted. This is a tragedy that we need to correct—not only for their sake, but for our own as well. The faithful service of righteous men and women will bring untold blessings to those whom they serve.
For instance, Joseph’s story reveals a consistent thread: Wherever he was, the people he served prospered. Potiphar was certainly not a God-fearing man, yet even he recognized that prosperity came to him because of Joseph (Genesis 39:2-6). A second Old Testament illustration is Daniel, whose service to Babylonian kings included interpreting visions and providing clear guidance. (See Daniel 2:1-49, Daniel 4:1-37, Daniel 5:1-31.) In both examples, leaders were blessed by the actions of their servants, and more importantly, the men in power gained an increased awareness of God.
Find the people in your life who have the gift of godly service. Spend time with them, and learn by working together for God’s glory. Emulate these people, stand beside them, and ask, “How can I serve with you?”—and “How can I serve you?”
