Trusting Godly Counsel
It’s never easy to hear correction, but we are blessed when we listen and respond humbly.
David, though deep in grief over losing his son, listened to Joab’s reprimand about putting aside his personal loss in order to lead the people well. Throughout his 40-year reign, David repeatedly heeded godly guidance. Was it easy for him to hear the rebuke? Of course not, but he was wise enough to know that on his own, he couldn’t see the situation from all angles and needed godly advice.
We, too, should seek wise counsel from trustworthy people. Sometimes we need outside wisdom because we are too close to the problem. At other points, we’re too heavily burdened with life’s hardships to be clear about the best direction to take. Then there are those days when we just don’t know what to do and need the guidance of someone who’s already walked the painful road before us.
What a gift it is to have people in our life who bravely urge us to fulfill God’s call and won’t allow us to neglect our role. What frustrating problem are you facing today? Who could help you see the situation a little more clearly? Ask God for wise friends and mentors to help you—as well as a humble heart to receive their aid.
