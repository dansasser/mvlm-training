The Role of the Wicked
To bring about redemption exactly according to design, God involved many types of people in the unfolding plan.
With hundreds of prophecies related to the Messiah, it shouldn’t surprise us that God used many people—believers, unbelievers, and even some wicked individuals—to ensure the Savior’s earthly life would unfold according to plan. For example, a census ordered by Caesar Augustus brought Joseph and Mary to Bethlehem, the city of Christ’s birth. (See Micah 5:2; Luke 2:1-4.)
What’s more, God used some of the most powerful men of the day to bring about His Son’s sacrificial death on the cross. Charges by the religious leaders helped turn the crowd against Jesus (Mark 15:9-11). Pilate condemned Him, and the Romans carried out the crucifixion. They even bartered for His clothes and chose not to break His legs, as predicted in Scripture. (See John 19:24; John 19:36.)
During the dark days between Jesus Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection, the disciples must have believed the messianic plan had been derailed. But God’s goal wasn’t to bring the political revolution some expected. His purpose in sending His Son was to redeem mankind: Jesus paid the death penalty for all our sins.
Many had a hand in the Savior’s story, but the ultimate responsibility was the Father’s. He gave His only Son over to death on behalf of the world that He loves.
