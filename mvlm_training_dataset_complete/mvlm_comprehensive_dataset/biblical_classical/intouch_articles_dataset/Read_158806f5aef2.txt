Understanding God’s Word
God reveals deeper truth to those who are committed to obeying Him.
1 Corinthians 2:12-16
1 Corinthians 2:12-16; 1 Corinthians 3:1-3
I just don’t understand the Bible.  Have you ever thought that? It’s clear why those without Christ are unable to grasp scriptural concepts, but why do those of us who know Him sometimes struggle?
The key here is obedience. As we act on what we read, the Holy Book “comes alive,” and we begin to hear and understand what God is communicating. However, if we haven’t obeyed things He’s previously revealed to us, why would He give us His deeper truths? Psalm 25:14 says, “The secret of the Lord is for those who fear Him,” and those who revere Him are the ones who obey His commandments and are promised “a good understanding” (Psalm 111:10).
Living a lifestyle of disobedience to the Lord distorts our vision, diminishes our ability to hear, and fogs our thinking. Although we have full access to the mind of Christ, our attachment to our own sinful ways keeps us from tapping into the rich treasures of wisdom found in His Word.
As you read the Scriptures each day, look for God’s instructions. Then with reliance upon the Holy Spirit, commit to do what He tells you. When you obey His voice, He’ll reveal deeper truths and your understanding will grow.
