Commit our ways to God. This means that we invite the Lord to examine our desires and intentions—and to change whatever does not fit His purpose for our life.
Trust Him. Who is more worthy of our faith than the Father, who gave Jesus Christ to save sinners? The One who would not spare His only Son will certainly provide all that His children need (Romans 8:32).
Rest in the Lord. When we fret, we are neither committing ourselves to the Lord nor trusting in Him. Because our human viewpoint is limited, waiting patiently isn’t easy. God, however, has infinite wisdom and knows when circumstances are perfectly aligned for His will to be done.
Though a growing relationship with the Lord can involve hard work, it is a labor of love. We are designed to derive joy and fulfillment from being in God’s presence. Walking alongside a Father who adores us is the greatest pleasure we can experience in life.
