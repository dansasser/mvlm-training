Praising the Lamb of God
We can worship God anywhere and anytime in many different ways.
In today’s reading, John’s revelation of heaven’s throne room is a striking picture of praise. The place explodes with worship and adoration. Those present—the elders and “myriads of myriads” of angels (v. 11)—sing of their love for Christ. He is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world (vv. 9, 12; John 1:29). And He’s the Lion of Judah (Rev. 5:5), the only one worthy to judge the earth and bring forth its renewal.
What motivates you to worship? Shouldn’t the reason for lifting our hands and voices be to praise our Savior for who He is? To do that, we must take the time to know Him. We have to commit ourselves to discovering Him through regular Bible study, prayer, and service to His kingdom. Once believers glimpse Christ’s character and learn He’s more amazing than they realized, they yearn to know Him better. There will be a hunger and thirst for God in their lives because only the Lord can satisfy (Matthew 5:6).
Praise is part of a cycle: Learn more of God’s character, love Him more deeply, worship and serve Him better, and receive spiritual fulfillment. Amazingly, even as we are satisfied, we continue to crave more of His presence in our life. And so we dig into His Word for more and begin the cycle again.
