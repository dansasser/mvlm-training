Failure is temporary only if we call on the Lord for help.
At salvation, a person becomes a brand-new creation and is set apart for God’s purposes. The Father has a specific plan for the life of every believer, and He provides each of His children with everything needed to accomplish it (2 Peter 1:3).
When Israel was under Philistine rule, the people all “did as they saw fit” (Judg. 21:25 NIV). God ordained that Samson be set apart for service—as the one who would “begin to deliver Israel from the hands of the Philistines” (Judges 13:5). In preparation for that mission, the Lord gave Samson godly parents, an upbringing uncontaminated by the culture, and stunning strength. Greatly blessed as he matured, the young man became judge over Israel, with the authority to carry out God’s will.
Samson was equipped with everything necessary to fulfill his God-given purpose. However, he had a moral weakness that led to his downfall and the loss of his remarkable strength. As a result, Samson had to endure suffering that included imprisonment, torture, and ridicule by his enemies. But ultimately, he turned in humility to God, who worked through him one final time.
Samson had enormous potential to do good on behalf of God. And so do we. Pray for the Lord’s help so you can stay focused on His plan and accomplish His will.
