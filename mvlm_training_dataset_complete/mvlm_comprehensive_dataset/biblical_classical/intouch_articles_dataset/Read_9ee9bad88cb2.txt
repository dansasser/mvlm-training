Since Jesus died on the cross for our sins, we can pursue God's will without the weight of guilt or shame.
Guilt can be defined as anxiety in one’s spirit over a deliberate, willful sin. We can trace this emotion all the way back to the garden of Eden. After Adam and Eve tasted the forbidden fruit, they felt ashamed of their nakedness and hid themselves (Genesis 3:10).
In ancient Israel, people would “pay” for their wrong by sacrificing an animal’s life. Today we no longer need such a brutal way to release our guilt; God has provided a better solution. He sent His Son Jesus to make a way for us to be redeemed and brought into a right relationship with Him. Our Savior made atonement for us with His precious blood. And—praise God!—Jesus rose to life again, conquering death and sin.
The truth is, every one of us has sinned and was separated from God (Romans 3:23). However, we can be liberated from death and guilt by accepting Jesus’ free gift and committing our life to Him. Of course, in our imperfect human state, we won’t be perfectly sinless. But our loving heavenly Father will continue to forgive His children (Ephesians 1:7).
Jesus’ sacrifice gives us freedom from shame and death—plus the promise of eternity with God. Though we are promised forgiveness, our gratitude and love for our Savior should spur us on to repentance, obedience, and service to the Lord.
