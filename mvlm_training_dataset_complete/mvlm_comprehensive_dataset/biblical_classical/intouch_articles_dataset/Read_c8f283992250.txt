Joy in God’s Presence
Draw near to God to discover authentic joy.
Today’s verse tells us, “You will make known to me the way of life; in Your presence is fullness of joy; in Your right hand there are pleasures forever.” What a promise! This scripture teaches that for us as God’s children, the delight of our Father’s presence is beyond measure and always available.
To help us appreciate this profound spiritual joy, let’s think about the pleasure derived from a more mundane source—a summer garden. In full bloom, a flower bed can be a riot of color, with variations of green, red, yellow, purple, white, and more. Blossoms release fragrance into air that is often filled with birdsong. It’s a treat for our senses.
But delight in God’s presence surpasses that of any human experience. In Him, the psalm says, we find “fullness of joy.” What’s more, His goodness is not dependent upon circumstances; it is always accessible—even when life is filled with concerns and hardships.
God’s presence and the blessings it brings will endure for all eternity. But cultivating a heart of gratitude, prayer, and worship can help us experience deep delight now. As we draw near Him, we will find solace in sorrow, strength in weakness, and hope in despair—all of which add to the fullness of our joy.
