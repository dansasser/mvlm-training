God has a good plan for each believer and will provide everything needed to accomplish His will.
People can offer God plenty of reasons why He shouldn’t call them to spread the gospel. But His call isn’t just a nice idea or a suggestion to try if they have time; He expects our obedience and humble surrender.
For Christians, the only appropriate response to God’s call is “Yes.” It’s His responsibility to equip us for the work He assigns. The Lord has a plan for the life of each believer, and He provides us with the temperament and enthusiasm for what He has in mind. Then He sees to it that we have skills that can be developed and the spiritual gifts necessary to fulfill His mission.
God determines His call with wisdom and discernment. He knows why He created each of us and what we’re capable of accomplishing in His strength (Ephesians 2:10). Rejecting the invitation to serve Him is foolish. It would be like telling Almighty God that He made a mistake. Surrender, on the other hand, opens the door to a lifetime of service, blessing, and joy.
Mission work can occur near or far. You could serve at home by writing to prisoners, down the street by volunteering at a children’s program, across the nation by providing flood relief, or in another country by translating the gospel. In short, a missionary calling is whatever God calls you to do.
