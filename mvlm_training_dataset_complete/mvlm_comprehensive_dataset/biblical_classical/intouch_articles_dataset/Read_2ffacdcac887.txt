The Holy Spirit uses the Bible to guide us—sometimes into the unknown.
Yesterday we studied the importance of trusting and waiting on God. Today, let’s look at three additional requirements:
Meditating. If we want to know the mind of God, we must meditate upon His Word (Psalm 119:27). We do not need to pick the “right” verses in order to know His will. He has the power to direct us from any portion of the Bible. Our part is to pursue wisdom through Scripture over a sustained period of time.
Listening. We must make an effort to learn how to recognize the prompting of the Holy Spirit. If we are studying a passage of Scripture, He will shed light on its meaning so we can understand how God is directing us. Or He will bring to remembrance a passage we have learned and reveal how it applies to our situation (John 14:26).
Walking. One final lesson regarding obedience is that sometimes we must walk even when the way is unclear. Abraham is a good example. The Lord told Him to move out of his homeland but did not specify the destination.
As the week begins, consider the importance of obedience in the life of faith. Then ask God what He wants you to work on first—trusting, waiting, meditating, listening, or walking with Him.
