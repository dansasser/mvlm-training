Knowing God as Our Father
In the Lord's Prayer, Jesus taught us to talk to God as our Father—because we are His children.
The Lord’s Prayer shows us something unique about God. In Jesus’ day, calling God “Father” (Matt. 6:9) was a radical and marvelous concept: The Israelites understood a national link between people and deity, but Jesus’ words made that connection a personal one.
How amazing that the Creator wants a relationship with us. By trusting Jesus as Savior, we’re welcomed into God’s family, though we can never be completely holy or perfect like Him. The bond is based on His great love and acceptance, not our abilities.
In today’s passage, the Lord’s Prayer teaches us to develop transparency and intimacy in our relationship with God—which is what a father/child connection should be. The pattern Jesus demonstrated directs us to share needs, confess sin, and admit weakness. Like the good Father He is, God responds to our petitions with love and wisdom” (Matthew 7:7; Matthew 21:22). He also makes His presence known during our quiet times, offering comfort and the assurance that He is always near.
Jesus’ prayer recognizes the Father’s holiness and sovereignty as well as His desire to be personally involved in our life. If you hunger to know God as a Father, follow the pattern of the Lord’s Prayer. As you open yourself to Him, He will draw close to you.
