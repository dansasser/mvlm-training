Resting in God’s Faithfulness
We can depend on the Lord absolutely and always.
When life seems to fall apart, we often wonder, Where is God? Why hasn’t He answered my prayers? The Bible offers us this encouragement: “Know therefore that the Lord your God, He is God, the faithful God, who keeps His covenant and His faithfulness to a thousand generations for those who love Him and keep His commandments” (Deuteronomy 7:9).
Five attributes of God make this possible. First, He is omniscient, which means He knows everything, including our every need, thought, and life situation—not just present but also past and future. Second, God is omnipotent, so nothing’s too hard for Him (Jeremiah 32:17). Third, He is omnipresent, so He is never beyond reach. Fourth, our heavenly Father can’t lie. Everything that He says is true and reliable. And fifth, God is unchanging. Our circumstances and the world may seem to be in a constant state of flux, and God may even modify the way He chooses to interact with us. But His character is always the same. So when Scripture says God is faithful, we can rest confidently upon that promise.
In situations that seem overwhelming, we can trust that our sovereign Lord knows all, is in control, and lovingly works everything for our good. We can rest confidently, knowing that the unchanging God of all creation is taking care of us.
