The Reality of God’s Love
Are you convinced of God's boundless love for you? If not, you can be.
2 Corinthians 11:23-27
2 Corinthians 11:23-27
Is there anything that prevents you from feeling confident that God loves you? Perhaps you’re convinced some sin from your past blocks His care and compassion. In that case, think about Paul. He violently persecuted Christians before he himself finally turned to the Lord. If such a man knew God loved him, would that help you realize you, too, are loved?
Whatever experiences you’re concerned about, Paul probably encountered something you can relate to. Yet he kept spreading his message of hope—that God loves us and sent His Son to die on the cross for our sins (John 3:16). Whether your situation is unfair, painful, or embarrassing, the fact that it happened doesn’t mean God has stopped loving you. Sometimes we face difficulty because He is polishing our rough edges and shaping us into His image. Other times trials instigated by Satan are allowed in our life through the Lord’s permissive will. Either way, God is working everything out to our good, according to His individualized purpose for each believer.
Here’s the key to accepting the truth of unconditional divine love: Focus on God rather than circumstances. When you’re learning of Him, talking with Him, and sharing your life with Him, trust and faith naturally replace doubt and fear.
