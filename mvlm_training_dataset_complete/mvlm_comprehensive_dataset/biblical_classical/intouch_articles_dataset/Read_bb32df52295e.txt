The Lamb Is Fighting for You
We can face the future with hope because Jesus will overcome every enemy we face.
Toward the end of the book of Revelation, the conflict intensifies between those who have aligned themselves with Jesus and those who oppose Him. Waves of God’s judgment unfold on earth and further harden His opponents’ hearts. But the overall message of Revelation isn’t doom and gloom; it’s hope. The book is meant to bring comfort to God’s people as they face tribulation.
Today’s reading contains a message of encouragement that relates to both the first and second coming of Christ. The prophet Isaiah said the Messiah would be known as “Immanuel,” meaning “God with us” (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:22-23). Jesus, the Lamb of God, gave His life for us, overcoming death. And He promised to be with us always. So, when we find ourselves in the midst of fiery trials and spiritual battles, we can rest in the assurance of today’s passage: “The Lamb will overcome them because He is the Lord of lords and King of kings; and those who are with Him are the called and chosen and faithful.”
Jesus will be with us to the end of time (Matthew 28:20). And Revelation reminds us that He will not only be near but will overcome His foes (and ours) because He is Ruler of all. He will have the final word. Our Savior wants us to know who He says we are: the called, chosen, and faithful. And since He is “Immanuel,” we can forever be with Him.
