God’s Tools for Making Us Holy
God uses the Bible, other believers, and even our struggles to mold us.
1 Thessalonians 5:23-24
1 Thessalonians 5:23-24
Sanctification is the process God uses to conform believers to His image. The writers of Scripture used imagery to depict this shaping work. Isaiah, for example, compared the Lord to an artist making pottery: “We are the clay, and You our potter; and all of us are the work of Your hand” (Isaiah 64:8). These are some of the tools He utilizes to mold and perfect His creations:
The Bible. God’s Word is described as “a lamp to [our] feet and a light to [our] path” (Psalm 119:105). The Holy Spirit illuminates our hearts through Scripture so we can come under conviction and grow in our faith.
The Church. As part of Christ’s body, we learn of God’s ways from those who have been called to minister. The Father also calls His children to enjoy fellowship together (Hebrews 10:25).
Challenges. God offers us solace and help during hard times, but He also uses trials to shape us. When we submit to Him, we emerge from struggles more Christlike than we were before.
From the moment a person places trust in Christ, God’s transforming work will be ongoing throughout his or her life. As children of the King, we should glorify our Father by faithfully reflecting Him. To do that, we must yield to His tools of sanctification.
