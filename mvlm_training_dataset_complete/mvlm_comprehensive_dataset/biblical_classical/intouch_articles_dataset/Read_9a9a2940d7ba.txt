God loves you—you can trust Him to do what is best for you.
Trusting God’s timing can be incredibly difficult when everything within us cries, “Do something!” When we’re dealing with a painful or challenging situation, we want action, so waiting for God feels passive.
To wait for the Lord means to pause for further instruction while remaining in the present circumstance. It is a purposeful, expectant focus on God—a choice to be still and quiet in our heart while listening for His voice and watching for His intervention (Psalm 46:10).
At times, God will change a situation to redirect us, or He will motivate another person to give guidance. However, always remember that any advice or direction we’re given must align with the Lord’s will as revealed in His Word; otherwise, it is not from Him.
The first step in waiting for the Lord is submission to His choice of how and when He will act. What are you hoping God will do? Are you seeking Him, or are you seeking only the thing that you want from Him? Since He alone knows what is best for you, let go and trust His decision.
