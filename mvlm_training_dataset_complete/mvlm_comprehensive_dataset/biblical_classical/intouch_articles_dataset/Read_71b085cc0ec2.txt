God’s Greatness—A Source of Comfort
Remember that God has the wisdom, strength, and compassion to meet all our needs.
David’s heartfelt cries fill the pages of the book of Psalms. Sometimes he makes requests, but many of his conversations with God focus on the Father’s greatness, love, power, and protection. In other words, David’s prayers are full of worship.
Consider these examples of psalms that focus on God’s attributes:
“Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence?” (Psalm 139:7). God is everywhere. He’s not limited by time or space—we’re never beyond His awareness or care.
“Great is our Lord and abundant in strength; His understanding is infinite” (Psalm 147:5). God knows everything. When we pray to Him, He’s already aware of our feelings and needs.
“Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good, for His lovingkindness is everlasting” (Psalm 136:1). God’s character is constant. Since we can always trust that He’ll be faithful, reliable, and merciful, we’re able to place our confidence in Him no matter the situation.
When we recall an attribute of the heavenly Father that meets our needs, we place the focus of our prayers on Him rather than the request. And then we’re more likely to pray for His will to be done—and to praise Him for who He is.
