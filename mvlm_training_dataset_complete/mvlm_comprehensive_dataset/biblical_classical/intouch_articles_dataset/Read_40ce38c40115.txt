Joseph: Forward by Faith
In the midst of trials, keep your eyes on your heavenly Father.
As believers, we all will falter occasionally in our faith. When that happens, how can we keep doubts to a minimum? The key is to remain focused on the Father so that we can move forward in His will for our life.
Consider Joseph, who trusted in God during all the harrowing events of his early years. Faith sustained him through betrayal, slavery, and imprisonment. Resting on his confidence in the heavenly Father, Joseph didn’t let his circumstances, environment, or the opinions of others divert him from acting in accordance with God’s will. He decided to do his work with excellence. His duties in Potiphar’s house were probably menial, but he performed them as if working for the Lord (Colossians 3:23-24). This kind of commitment earned Joseph the attention and respect of his master, and the Hebrew slave was rewarded with greater responsibility. Genesis 39:23 says, “And whatever he did, the Lord made to prosper.”
As he moved through one hardship after another, Joseph stayed focused on the Lord, who’d revealed intentions to raise him to a position of leadership (Genesis 37:10). Joseph had a practical approach to the downward turn in his fortunes: He kept thinking about God and serving Him instead of dwelling on his trials.
