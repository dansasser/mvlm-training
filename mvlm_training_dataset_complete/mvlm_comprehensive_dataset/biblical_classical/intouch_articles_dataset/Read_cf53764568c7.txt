The Lord has a wonderful plan for blessing and fulfillment in your life.
How do we become successful? Contrary to the world’s common definition—which usually involves fame, fortune, or power—true success means becoming the person God wants each of us to be. Hebrews 12:1 offers His perspective on this: “Therefore, since we also have such a great cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let’s rid ourselves of every obstacle and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let’s run with endurance the race that is set before us.”
Here, we see the keys to success. First, it is important to find encouragement from the lives of other believers who have seen Christ’s faithfulness and followed His directions. Next, we should get rid of anything that holds us back from obeying God. Finally, we are to persevere, even through difficult or discouraging times. Today’s passage answers our original question: We achieve success only by relying on Jesus for guidance and strength.
God has a wonderful plan for blessing and fulfillment in your life, and part of His plan is that you live with purpose and persistence. The Father’s guidance will become clearer as you read His Word, pray for direction, and seek godly counsel. Does your definition of success for your life match the good plan God has for you?
