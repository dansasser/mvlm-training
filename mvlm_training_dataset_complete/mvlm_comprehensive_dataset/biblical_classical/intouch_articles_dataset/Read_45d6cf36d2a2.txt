Practice these four steps to improve your ability to respond with courage.
What would you say if the Lord asked you to take on a leadership role, as He asked Joshua? The Lord wants us to respond with courage when He calls us to tackle something beyond our ability. How can we do this? Here are four steps:
1. Meditate on God’s Word. We are to search for Scripture’s meaning as if we’re hunting for treasure. With the Spirit’s help, we will understand the Bible and learn how to apply its wisdom to our situation.
2. Obey the Word. Scripture is meant to shape our thinking and behavior. As we contemplate biblical truths, they become imprinted on our mind and influence our actions (Psalm 119:11).
3. Trust in God’s promises. Joshua moved the Israelites across the Jordan River toward Jericho because he took God at His word.
4. Remember previous victories. Recalling the Lord’s past protection and faithfulness gives us the courage to trust Him in the future.
Practicing these steps will empower us to focus on victory rather than defeat, disregard unwarranted fearfulness in others, and obey God. What’s one area in your life where you can choose to trust the Lord and be courageous today?
