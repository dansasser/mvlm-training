Bridge to God’s Promises
Faith is the pathway to abundant life in the Lord.
Northern California is home to the Golden Gate Bridge, a famous landmark and marvel of human engineering. Stretching across the strait between San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean, it connects two shores that were once separated and provides safe passage across the expanse.
In our spiritual life, faith can also be seen as a type of bridge—one that links us, who were once far from God, to His promises (Isaiah 59:2). This span is foundational to our relationship with the Lord, offering hope on our journey. And the more we immerse ourselves in God’s Word and absorb His principles, the stronger this bridge of faith becomes. We can depend on it to provide safety as we navigate life’s trials.
As believers, we can find comfort knowing we’re connected to God’s love, grace, and redemption. Through faith, we can walk boldly on the path Jesus has laid out for us, safely traversing chasms of danger and doubt.
Whenever you see a bridge, let it serve as a symbol of how faith unites us with the living God and guides us to abundant life in Him. And keep in mind that a regular intake of Scripture reinforces our “bridge,” adding to its strength and stability.
