When Doubt Is at Work
Doubt robs us of the opportunity to see God work in our life.
Doubt can fill us with uncertainty, make us indecisive, and affect our ability to connect with God. We know doubt is at work when we struggle to believe the following truths:
God loves us all the time. His love for us does not fluctuate with our behavior. We can be certain of this because “God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8). That’s amazing grace—God loving us while we rebelled against Him.
God has a plan to forgive us for our disobedience. We know the Father promises to forgive us when we confess our sins, but we often have trouble believing we are forgiven. That’s why we must not use feelings to determine truth. God’s Word is true, and it says, “As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us” (Psalm 103:12).
God has called us to serve Him. Our heavenly Father often invites us to join Him in His work, but doubt might cause us, like Moses, to make excuses for why we can’t obey (Ex. 4:10). Yet God promises He has equipped us with everything we need to do the work He has chosen for us (Ephesians 2:10).
We’ll all experience doubt but can’t allow it to blind us to the truth: We are cherished and protected by the God of all creation.
