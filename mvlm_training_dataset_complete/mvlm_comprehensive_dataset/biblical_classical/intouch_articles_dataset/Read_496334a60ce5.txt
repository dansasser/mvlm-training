Relying on our own knowledge and strength robs us of the blessings that come from following God.
Whenever challenges come into our life, there are two ways we can respond to them: God’s way or ours. Moses is an example of a man who tried out both options. In today’s passage, we see him taking matters into his own hands. Although his motives were pure, his method was wrong. Moses made three mistakes.
1. He focused on the difficulty. How often have we done the same thing? The unfairness or pain of a situation grabs our attention, and in our desire for a solution, we act without first seeking the Lord.
2. He relied on his own strength and understanding. When a problem arises, the most natural response is to do what we can to fix it. However, God wants us to rely on Him, not on ourselves (Proverbs 3:5-6).
3. He acted impulsively. If a situation seems urgent, fixing the problem as fast as possible becomes our top priority. In our haste, we’re likely to forgo waiting on the Lord.
We’ve all followed Moses’ example at some point and suffered the consequences of self-reliance. But notice that God didn’t reject Moses or cancel the divine plan for his life. Instead, He refined the future leader’s character through trials and gave him another chance—and He’ll do the same for us.
