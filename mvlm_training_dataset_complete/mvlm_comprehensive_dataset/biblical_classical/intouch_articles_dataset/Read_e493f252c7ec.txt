Baptism: A Picture of Salvation
Jesus died for our sins so we can live forever with Him in heaven.
You’ve probably heard the old saying “A picture is worth a thousand words.” Pictures communicate in ways that words cannot, and they’re often helpful in reinforcing a message. Baptism is like that—it’s a powerful image of our salvation experience.
When we enter the waters of baptism, we are proclaiming the gospel message—that Jesus died for our sins, was buried, and lives again. Plunging beneath the surface draws the picture of our old self being buried with Him (Romans 6:4). Being raised up out of the water expresses our new life in Christ and our union with Him. Just as our heavenly Father physically raised Jesus from the dead and gave Him life, He has done the same for us spiritually.
In addition, baptism is a public declaration of both our faith in Jesus and our confidence about our own future resurrection. After appearing to many on earth, Jesus ascended into heaven to take His rightful place at His Father’s side. Someday we, too, will receive a resurrection body, and we’ll live forever with Him.
Baptism is a reminder of what the Savior has done for us. It points to the truth that there is life beyond the grave: Everlasting existence in the presence of the Lord awaits everyone who has chosen to trust in Christ. Have you publicly identified yourself with Jesus through the act of baptism?
