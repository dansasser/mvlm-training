What scares you? God invites you to bring it to Him and receive His peace and courage.
Numbers 13:1-33; Numbers 14:1-45
You’ve probably heard that the Israelites wandered in the wilderness for 40 years, but do you know why? Because in their fear, they doubted God’s call. He had intended for the Israelites to finally inhabit the Promised Land, but when Moses sent spies to scope it out, they reported, “The people who live in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large” (Num. 13:28). The Israelites became afraid and mistrusted what the Lord had said. As a result, they didn’t reach the land of milk and honey.
One of the reasons we, like the Israelites, often question what we’ve heard from God is the fear of failure. Feeling afraid is a normal, human response, but it’s also an internal cue that it’s time to do two things:
1. Investigate what is going on inside: What is scaring you? How do you think God views this situation? How do you believe He’ll respond to your feelings?
2. Connect with the Father. You are always safe to share your fears with God—He wants to know about them.
It’s the Lord’s desire that we move through life with confidence and assurance in Him (2 Timothy 1:7). Whenever fear tempts you to change course, take a moment to pause, look inward, and talk to God.
