Abraham—An Obedient Father
Is there anything you're holding back from the Lord?
Genesis 18:1-33 tells us about unexpected visitors to Abraham’s tent: Three men appeared out of nowhere, declaring that Sarah would give birth to a son. This announcement—which was surprising enough since it came from strangers—was even more unusual because of Sarah’s advanced age. Before long, however, Abraham and Sarah rejoiced when God kept His promise and gave them Isaac.
A few chapters later, though, God told Abraham, “Take now your son, your only son, whom you love … and offer him there as a burnt offering” (Genesis 22:2). The next morning, Abraham woke up to do what God had said. Then, just as he was about to slaughter his beloved child, God provided a ram instead.
It’s not clear how old the boy was when God asked for him to be offered as a sacrifice, but Isaac trusted his earthly father just as Abraham trusted his heavenly Father. They may have had questions or been afraid, but they chose to obey God anyway.
Abraham was ready to give up what was most precious to him—and to do so without grumbling. But why would he be willing to obey when the stakes were so high? Because he truly knew God’s goodness and believed the Lord would bless his obedience, no matter how painful.
You can know God just as intimately, and with just as much confidence in His love. Ask Him to show you the way.
