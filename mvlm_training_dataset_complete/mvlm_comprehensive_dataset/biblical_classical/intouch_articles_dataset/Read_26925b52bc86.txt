Our Missionary Calling
The Holy Spirit calls and empowers us to share our faith in Christ.
To understand God’s view of mission work, let’s look at today’s passage. Paul and Barnabas set the standard when they obeyed God’s call to go forth, and some in the local body of believers prayed over the men and sent them on their journey. They carried out the work for the same reasons that apply today:
The spiritual condition of mankind. Romans 1:21-32 describes this sinful world. Unchecked sin leads people down a slippery slope toward even greater brokenness, lost relationships, suffering, and heartache.
God’s spiritual provision. The Father responded with grace to mankind’s plight: He sent His only Son Jesus Christ to save the world. On the cross, Christ bore the sin of every person. Those who believe in the Savior are forgiven of all their transgressions, and they will spend eternity with the Lord.
The commission from Jesus Christ. Acts 1:8 says that we receive the Holy Spirit so we may bear effective witness to those who need salvation.
It is not merely a suggestion but a command that we share the good news and make disciples (Matthew 28:19). Believers living in God’s will are to be involved in missionary work. Some will go and some will send, but all are called to spread the gospel.
