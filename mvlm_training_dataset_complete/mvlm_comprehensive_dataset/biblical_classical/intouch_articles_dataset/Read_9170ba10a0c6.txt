God doesn't bear grudges. If you have confessed your mistakes, He's ready to lead you to abundant life.
During Jesus’ trial, Peter had denied Him three times, and now Jesus was risen, just as He’d promised. Who wouldn’t have felt ashamed? It would’ve been enough to send anyone back to something familiar, something safe. In John 21, we see Peter abruptly announce, “I am going fishing” (v. 3). So there he is, back on the water, doing what he knows best. Except the fishing is bad. They’ve caught nothing, so when a stranger appears on the shore and says, “Cast the net on the right-hand side of the boat,” they figure it’s worth a try (v. 6). The catch nearly swamps the boat, and John—probably remembering another miraculous catch (Luke 5:1-11)—says, “It is the Lord!” As abruptly as he decided to go fishing, Peter jumps into the water and hurries to shore.
After breakfast, Jesus has spiritual business to tend to with Peter. His disciple hasn’t died, but neither is he living in the abundance Jesus promised. Peter has experienced a kind of death by denial. He needs Jesus’ tough questions to resurrect his bruised faith and restore him to leadership and life.
Our own denials may not rise to Peter’s level, but we are asked to trust Jesus in every situation. Sometimes we don’t, but Jesus’ fireside talk with Peter reminds us that He can restore anyone to the new life He’s promised.
