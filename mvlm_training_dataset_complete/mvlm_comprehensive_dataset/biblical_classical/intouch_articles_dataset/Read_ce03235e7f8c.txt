Difficult times come into every life. Choose to rely on our sovereign God for comfort and care.
Hard times are inevitable. Loved ones die. Friends face sickness. Our spouse loses his or her job. The range of human pain is broad, but God “comforts us in all our affliction” (2 Corinthians 1:4).
Today’s passage speaks of great calamities, some from natural causes and others brought about by men (vv. 2, 6). Such trials often bewilder us, but verse 10 tells us where to turn. God’s followers should be still and remember He’s the sovereign Lord of the universe. The key to dealing with difficulty lies in trusting the One who controls all things.
Instead of trying to manage the situation ourselves, we should actively wait for God to move and trust that He will work on our behalf (Isaiah 64:4). This involves taking time to be alone with our Father—crying out to Him, meditating on His Word, and listening to Him.
Human instinct urges us to take control ourselves; in contrast, God wants us to patiently and expectantly wait on Him. He also tells us to surrender what we think is right and submit to His plan.
What’s your response when trouble arises? Whether your current circumstances are good or painful, take time to be still before the Lord, and trust that He is in control.
