Take time to recall stories of God's faithfulness and share them with the people in your life.
Today we read about Moses gathering the people together so the entire nation could enter into a covenant with God. But he didn’t begin the way we might expect—with details of the oath, what the people must do, what the Lord would do, or the consequences of faithfulness or unfaithfulness. Instead, Moses began by reminding the people of all that God had already done.
Oh, the things they had seen with their own eyes! The things they had touched with their hands and tasted with their lips! God had entered their lives in tangible, unmistakable ways, and because of these experiences and memories, they knew “the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may follow all the words of this law” (v. 29 NIV).
Today, it’s still true that we gain confidence in God and trust for the future when we remember what He has already done in our life. But holding tightly to these memories can be harder than it sounds.
What are the stories of your faith and your family? How and when has God met you, led you, fed you? Let’s find ways to tell these stories—to ourselves, our children, and our children’s children.
