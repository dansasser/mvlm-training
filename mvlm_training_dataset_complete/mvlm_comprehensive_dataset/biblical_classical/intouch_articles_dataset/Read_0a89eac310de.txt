Don't let life's busyness distract you from the important work of intercession.
Let’s continue using Paul’s prayer as a model. Yesterday, we made note of the first two requests. Now let’s consider the other four. In Colossians 1, Paul prays that his brothers and sisters would:
• Bear fruit in every good work (v. 10)—The Lord desires that our actions bring Him glory. We all seem to be very busy, but the amount of work isn’t what matters. Instead, we must be sure that the things we do are eternally valuable.
• Grow in the knowledge of God (v. 10)—The apostle’s request is not merely for believers to gain facts regarding Christ. He speaks of a deeper understanding in the heart.
• Be strengthened according to His power (v. 11)—Having endurance and focus in the midst of life’s trials requires God’s strength. Our own simply isn’t enough.
• Walk in gratitude (v. 12)—When we realize where all good gifts originate, we live with thankfulness. Contentment and joy come from a grateful heart, not our circumstances.
Life is busy, so prayer often gets squeezed out of our schedules. We must always remember that lifting our loved ones before God’s throne is far more important than any other task.
