Have you submitted your mind to the Lord?
The human mind is an amazing creation of God. Nothing on earth can match its capabilities or creativity. It generates feelings, thoughts, words, attitudes, and behaviors—who we become and what we achieve are largely due to how and what we think. So, doesn’t it make sense to let the One who created us guide our thought processes?
To do that, we need to align our mind with God’s Word and allow His Spirit to influence us. As this happens, God gives discernment, empowering us to look beyond the surface and view situations as they really are—in other words, as He sees them. Then we can distinguish not just between right and wrong but also between good and best.
Yet such clear, focused thinking doesn’t just happen. We must deliberately choose and diligently maintain it. So let’s carefully consider what we allow into our mind. Ask yourself, Is this helping me become the person God wants me to be, or is it hindering the process?
Though we have a responsibility to participate in the transformation, a renewed mind ultimately comes from the Lord. True change requires full dependence on Him, not on our own abilities and strength. Ask God to help you lean on Him and fill your mind with His Word.
