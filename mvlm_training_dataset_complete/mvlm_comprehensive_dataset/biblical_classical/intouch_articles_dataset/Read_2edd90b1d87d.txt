Helping Those in Need
A genuine expression of godly love can transform someone's life.
In Matthew 22:39, Jesus tells us the second greatest commandment is, “Love your neighbor as yourself.” A wonderful way to demonstrate care for others is to follow the Lord’s example and bear their burdens.
One way Jesus did this was by helping people who were hurting or rejected. Bartimaeus (Mark 10:46-52), the woman caught in adultery (John 8:3-11), and those who were demon-possessed (Matthew 4:24) are just a few examples.
Like Jesus, we shouldn’t just bear the burdens of our friends and relatives. There are people who will never hold opinions similar to ours or share our interests. But they might be in need of somebody to help during their difficulties, too. A genuine expression of godly love can transform a person’s life.
Even when we understand that lifting someone else’s load fulfills the law of Christ (Galatians 6:2), we might think we’re not equal to the task and be tempted to pass the responsibility to a “more qualified” believer. But the Lord intends something different for us. Our unique experiences equip us to help in ways that others cannot. Ask God how you can begin to help bear the burdens of your neighbors, and know you’ll be blessed mightily in the process.
