Breaking Down Faith Barriers
As you seek to follow God, He will help you overcome each obstacle you encounter.
Yesterday, we discussed how Moses doubted God’s calling to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. But the Lord graciously provided reassurance through wondrous signs and promised to help His servant accomplish everything, no matter how impossible it might seem (Ex. 4:1-5).
Moses wasn’t eloquent, and his inability to speak well left him feeling inadequate. So God reassured him by saying, “I Myself will be with your mouth, and instruct you in what you are to say” (v. 12). Remember, the Lord looks at the heart, not human qualifications (1 Samuel 16:7), which is why the people He chooses to carry out His plan often seem unlikely. What’s more, God can also overcome all our inadequacies. That’s what He did by calling Moses’ brother Aaron to go along and proclaim the God-given message (Ex. 4:14-17).
The Lord had an answer for each one of Moses’ concerns, and He will likewise help us overcome obstacles when we follow Him. As we step out in obedience, our trust in God grows, and we are able to leave the outcome—whatever it may be—to Him. Then, as the faith barriers in our life are demolished, we’ll be able to see the evidence of God’s presence and power. Not only that, but we will also experience the joy of submitting to His perfect will.
