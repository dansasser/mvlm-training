The Struggle With Guilt
Jesus completely paid the penalty for all our sins—we don't need to punish ourselves.
Yesterday, we saw that because of Jesus’ sacrifice, we’re free from guilt. But at times we still feel ashamed. So let’s look a little deeper.
There are two types of guilt: biblical and false. The first originates with the violation of Scripture. This is not a feeling but a reality: We have sinned and should repent. The second, which involves continuing to feel guilty after confessing a sin, is not based in truth or supported by the Bible. God has forgiven us (Psalm 103:12), so there is no need to linger in shame.
People struggle with false guilt for many reasons. Legalistic teaching, for example, presents life as a series of rules that can never be followed perfectly. Self-reproach can also derive from verbal put-downs. Another cause is perfectionism—expectations we’re incapable of attaining can flood us with self-condemnation.  Guilt leads us to doubt God’s love and salvation, which paves the way for fear and insecurity and leaves us unable to enjoy life. It can also open the door to physical and mental stress.
The heavenly Father wants His children to live free from guilt (Romans 8:1). If you experience shame, ask Him to help you trace its cause. Then affirm these truths: You are special (made in God’s image and redeemed by Him), loved by the Creator of the universe, and forgiven.
