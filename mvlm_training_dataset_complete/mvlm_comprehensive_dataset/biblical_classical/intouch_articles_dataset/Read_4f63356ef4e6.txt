Jesus paid the ultimate price so that we can have peace with God.
Isaiah 40 reveals a shift in God’s communication with His people. In the previous 39 chapters, He spoke through the prophet about their sin and called them to repentance. But as chapter 40 begins, God’s emphasis moves from judgment to the hope of restoration.
Imagine the surprise the Israelites felt as they heard His words to the prophet: “Comfort, comfort My people ... Speak kindly to Jerusalem” (Isa. 40:1-2). They no longer heard words of condemnation for their disobedience. God, in His mercy, declared their sins removed.
But that wasn’t all He had to say. Verses 3 and 5 point to a more profound truth that deserved a triumphant procession: “Clear the way for the Lord in the wilderness ... Then the glory of the Lord will be revealed, and all flesh will see it together.”
What glory would be revealed for all to see? Those words told of Jesus—God’s Word made flesh (John 1:14), who paid the ultimate price to fully restore us to God. Jesus, the One the angels announced as they filled the sky in worship, declaring, “Glory to God in highest heaven, and peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased” (Luke 2:14 NLT).
