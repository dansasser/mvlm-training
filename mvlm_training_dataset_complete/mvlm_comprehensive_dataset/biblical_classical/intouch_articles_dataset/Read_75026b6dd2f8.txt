The Blessing of Giving
As we take time to see and appreciate God's goodness, our natural response will be to give joyfully.
Have you ever noticed that the more skilled you are at something, the more you enjoy it? For example, when an orchestra plays a masterpiece, an accomplished musician will likely derive greater pleasure from listening than would a person with an untrained ear. You might be surprised to learn the same is true of giving.
God has many reasons for us to give. First, returning a portion of our wealth to the Lord acknowledges that everything actually belongs to Him (Psalm 50:10). Second, God tells us to give, as He has given to us (Deuteronomy 16:17). Third, contributing to a cause or helping another person is kingdom work, which brings us deep joy. Fourth, our offerings are an opportunity for God to reveal His character. As we demonstrate generosity, He faithfully provides for our needs and blesses us abundantly (2 Corinthians 9:8).
Giving involves more than our money. God has also blessed us with talents, time, and resources. It’s important to rely on the Holy Spirit’s guidance to know what and how much we should give as well as to whom we should give it.
Remember, the Lord is continuously blessing us—with salvation, comfort, encouragement, and countless other good things. We should give back, not out of obligation but with a heart of gratitude and joy (2 Corinthians 9:7).
