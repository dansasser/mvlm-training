Choose to trust God and face your challenges with courage.
What do the following people have in common: Joshua, the Israelite leader; Daniel, the visionary; Jesus’ disciples; and the apostle Paul? For one thing, they were all dedicated followers of God. But in addition to that, they all needed great courage.
For example, Joshua was called to lead the nation of Israel into the Promised Land. Perhaps he thought, Who am I to follow in Moses’ footsteps? or What if the people don’t support my leadership? God spoke reassuringly to him three times, telling him to be strong and courageous. Joshua responded with faith and based his bravery on two precious assurances:
1. God travels with us. The Lord pledged to be with the Israelites in the new land. He makes a similar promise to us and, in fact, travels with us in a far more intimate way—through His indwelling Spirit (John 14:16-17).
2. God goes before us. The Lord promised to take care of the enemy before the Israelites arrived. They still faced battles, but He assured them of victory if they obeyed. Jesus has already won the spiritual battle through His death on the cross. Our redemption has been secured and our place in God’s family established.
Ask God to help you trust in these two promises and to face each day with courage.
