Our Savior wants everyone to experience His grace, mercy, and everlasting love.
Some people imagine God getting frustrated every time they make a mistake. As a result, many of them live in constant fear of doing something wrong. But that’s not who God is at all. Instead, He has endless patience and mercy for His children.
The Lord knows we have a fallen nature, and He completely understands our struggle against it (Hebrews 4:15). Just as a toddler learns obedience, God’s children also learn to walk in His ways. Because our Father takes pleasure in watching us do what is right, He allows us time and room for mistakes.
Now, if we repeatedly reject the salvation God provides, then we’ll experience His judgment one day. That choice is real. But keep in mind that Jesus came into the world specifically to save sinners. He wants everyone to be saved—and with great patience, mercy, and grace, He generously gives everyone time to come to Him.
God is always waiting and ready for us to return to His loving embrace, just like the father of the prodigal son. Is there anything you want to confess to the Lord today? Repentance will open a blocked line of communication. Remember, God is slow to anger, and He enjoys spending time with you.
