When we are waiting for our Savior to act, it helps to remember His heart is tender toward us.
We live in a fast-paced society, where many of our whims and desires can be gratified instantaneously. It takes discipline to refrain from acting on impulses of the flesh and instead to wait for God’s perfect timing. Without the help of the Holy Spirit, we can quickly become overeager and restless.
Consider the patience and restraint it took for Jesus to use His power in accordance with His Father’s will—especially while someone close to Him suffered and died. On learning that Lazarus was sick, the Lord delayed for two days instead of rushing to His beloved friend’s bedside. Why? Because Jesus knew that God’s plan of redemption was far bigger than the mere prevention of death through physical healing. God’s plan for Lazarus, for Jesus, and for all who call on His name is resurrection from death and to eternal life.
When we witness suffering and death in the world, it can be easy to lose heart. But Jesus’ example in waiting on His Father’s timing to resurrect Lazarus invites us to patiently bear all things. We aren’t alone in our waiting or weeping; Jesus wept, too. As people of hope, we know how the story ends: He will wipe every tear from our eyes, and death will be no more (Revelation 21:4).
