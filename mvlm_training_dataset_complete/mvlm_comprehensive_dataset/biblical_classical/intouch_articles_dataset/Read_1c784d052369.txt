The Legacy of Faithfulness
Praise God today for those who have demonstrated that we can depend on Jesus.
Some churches celebrate their heritage of godly, faithful people on November 1. Similarly, in Hebrews 11—which is called the Bible’s “Hall of Faith”—the writer showcases the people who endured faithfully, trusting in God’s promises.
The stories of those men and women remind us that walking by faith is a lifelong journey. Like them, we’ll need to exercise faith again and again, even when we don’t “receive what was promised” (v. 39). We can see from their lives that faith depends not on human strength or understanding, but on God’s character and faithfulness. We also learn that He “provide[s] something better” (v. 40)—He created us, called us to relationship with Him, and lovingly guides us each step of the way.
Bible stories also remind us that we’re part of a larger story—one that stretches all the way back to Abraham and will continue long after we have joined the saints who’ve gone before us. We can be thankful that in our struggles, we don’t struggle alone. We can persevere, running “the race ... set before us,” because we remember this “great cloud of witnesses surrounding us” (Hebrews 12:1). These fathers and mothers in the faith are reminders to depend on Jesus, who demonstrated perfect and unwavering trust in His Father. Best of all, we can celebrate that God writes us into the same story, strengthening the legacy of faithfulness we will pass to those who follow us.
