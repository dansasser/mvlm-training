Accountability Is Scriptural
Accountability benefits both the individual and the church as a whole.
While there are plenty of biblical directives about accountability, the idea of revealing details from our private life makes many of us feel vulnerable. Christians don’t have an option, however. It is clear that we’re meant to be mutually supportive and transparent. Consider James 5:16, which says, “Confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed.”
Regardless of one’s position, everybody is accountable to somebody. This holds true for the entire family of faith, including leaders. For instance, church members take direction from a pastor (Hebrews 13:17), and Paul tells us to be subject to one another (Ephesians 5:21) while he himself was answerable to the church (Acts 14:27). The apostles were under the authority of Jesus (Luke 10:1-12), even as Jesus was subject to the Father (John 8:28-29). The Bible also tells us the church is obedient to the Lord Jesus Christ (Ephesians 5:24). This mutual accountability is healthy, benefiting both the individual and the body as a whole.
People avoid accountability for various reasons—like pride, ignorance, fear, and self-reliance. This is a dangerous approach to life. Our enemy knows our weaknesses and how to exploit them. But we can prevail with the support of friends. There is strength in the body of Christ.
