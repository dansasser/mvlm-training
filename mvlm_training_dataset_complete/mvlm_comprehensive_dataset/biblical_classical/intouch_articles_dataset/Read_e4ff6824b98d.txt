When we choose to trust the Lord, He will use not only our strengths but also our weaknesses to accomplish His purposes.
After being called by Jesus, Peter immediately left his fishing career to lead a life of discipleship and service. The man was far from perfect, but we can learn much from his transformation.
When Jesus asked the disciples who they believed He was, Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God” (Matthew 16:16). Similarly, our words and actions should proclaim to those around us that we trust in Jesus as the Messiah and we belong to Him. The basis for our identity—in public and in private—ought to be that we are His followers.
After Christ’s arrest, Peter’s faith faltered. Just as the Lord had predicted, the apostle refused three times to acknowledge their relationship. The disciple wept bitterly about what he’d done (Matthew 26:69-75). But following the resurrection, Jesus forgave Peter and then called him to love the “sheep” (John 21:15-17). After being filled with the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, Peter began his ministry by sharing the gospel with thousands of people. (See Acts 2:6-11; Acts 2:41.) Through God’s power, many were saved.
Peter is an example of the type of person our Father can use—someone with strengths and weaknesses, who learns from mistakes and is surrendered to the Lord for His purposes. Have you committed yourself to following God’s plan for your life?
