We may not always understand what God allows, but we can always trust who He is.
Yesterday we discussed closed doors. Now let’s look at some reasons why God might block our way. Closed doors ...
Prevent mistakes. Just because a path is clear doesn’t mean it’s the one God wants us to follow. Sometimes we won’t have the information we need to make a wise decision, so He bars the way either spiritually or physically. The Holy Spirit can see the whole road map for our life, which is why we are to follow His guidance.
Redirect our walk. Sometimes God has a different opportunity in mind—one that will yield bigger fruit, more contentment, and greater impact for the kingdom.
Test faith and build perseverance. Waiting for the Lord to speak or act is hard. But we’ll learn wisdom, patience, and trust by pausing prayerfully until He reveals His will.
Buy us time. God may temporarily hold shut an opportunity for service until a believer is properly equipped for kingdom work.
Despite the repeated references to “closed doors” in this devotion, the real message is that God opens doors. He has created a perfect pathway for us to follow. Keep your feet on it, and you will walk over thresholds leading to service, satisfaction, and glory for the Lord.
