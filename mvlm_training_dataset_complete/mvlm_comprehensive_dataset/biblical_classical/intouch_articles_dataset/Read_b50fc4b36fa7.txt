Though trials are painful, those who cling to God will benefit from them.
Most likely, you’ve heard the question, “If God is good, how can He let bad things happen?” Since the fall of man, life has always included hardship. Though trials are painful, understanding the Lord’s purpose can bring joy and hope.
The Word of God is clear that suffering is purposeful: God is conforming His children to be like Jesus (2 Corinthians 3:18). Sanctification, which begins at the moment of salvation, is the process of becoming holy—and few things build character like sorrow.
Another reason the Father allows trials is to test the faith of His children. Of course, He is omniscient and doesn’t need this for His own information; it is believers who benefit. Tested faith is stronger and more reliable than faith that remains untried.
Furthermore, God allows hardship in order to reveal His character, love, and power. During hard times, people who cling to their heavenly Father will find Him trustworthy and real. When the next difficulty arises, they’ll remember His faithfulness during the previous trial and will rest confidently in Him.
We can learn certain things from books and other people’s stories, but it is often during hardship that personal growth occurs. So, when problems occur and sorrow seems piercing, thank God for His purpose in your challenges.
