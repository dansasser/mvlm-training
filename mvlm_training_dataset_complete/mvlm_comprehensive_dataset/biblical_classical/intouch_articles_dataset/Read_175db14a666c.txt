The Riches of God’s Grace
Because of Christ, we can receive God's choicest gifts.
What would it take for you to consider yourself rich? A large bank account? A fancy car in the garage? You may not be so bold as to answer “yes,” but does your life reflect this attitude? Sadly, many believers are overtaken by the world’s standard of riches and define wealth by how much they possess.
This happens whether one is wealthy or not. For the well-off, the temptation is to see money as the defining characteristic of their life; for the poor, money becomes the be-all-end-all goal of comfort and satisfaction. Greed plagues rich and poor alike.
What many believers fail to realize is that in Christ, we are all rich. Sure, you may have bills to pay, but if you have placed your faith in Jesus, you can boldly acknowledge that God has already poured His richest blessings upon you (Ephesians 2:4-7).
Today’s passage says that God has blessed us with every spiritual blessing (v. 3). Did you notice the tense of the verb there? The past tense—“has blessed”—is used, meaning it’s already happened. And He does not give just a little bit here and there; rather, He lavishly pours out His blessings on us.
Look beyond your finances and prayerfully list as many of your blessings as you can. Tomorrow, we will take a closer look at some of God’s choicest gifts.
