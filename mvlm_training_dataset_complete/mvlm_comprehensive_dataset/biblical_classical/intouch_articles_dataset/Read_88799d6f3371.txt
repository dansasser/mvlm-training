Developing Godly Habits
God blesses those who persevere, working hard to carry out His will.
Picture this: In a field nestled among rolling hills, a hardworking farmer toils day after day, sowing seeds and nurturing tender plants. From dawn till dusk, he tends to the crops, knowing that lazy hands yield no harvest. With unwavering faith and persistence, the farmer trusts that the output of labor will be rewarded.
Proverbs 10:4 tells us, “Poor is one who works with a lazy hand, but the hand of the diligent makes rich.” This proverb is about more than material wealth; it speaks to the richness of a diligent life. As a bountiful harvest results from industrious labor, so our life is shaped by our habits—the choices we make day after day.
Through prayer and obedience, we align ourselves with God’s plans instead of our own. This is how we cultivate habits grounded in His Word. This kind of diligence goes hand in hand with stewardship of our time, talents, relationships, and resources. Wisely using such things for God’s glory will bring a good return for His kingdom.
As we approach 2024, let’s prayerfully evaluate our habits. Are we using our time purposefully? Are we nurturing relationships that honor God? Are we faithfully stewarding our resources? Seek God’s guidance and make intentional choices that align with His will.
