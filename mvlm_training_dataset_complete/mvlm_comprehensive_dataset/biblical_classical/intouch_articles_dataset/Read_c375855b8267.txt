The Blessings of Inadequacy
Will you choose to be limited by what you can do, or will you trust God and be amazed by what He can do?
Paul never said he was capable of doing all that God called him to do. He simply learned to look beyond his own inadequacy to the sufficiency of Christ. And if we adopt the same practice, we’ll be able to discover the blessings hidden in our own experiences of inadequacy. So keep in mind:
Our insufficiency should drive us to God. When we realize a situation is bigger than we can handle, we ought to quickly open the Bible and diligently pray for guidance and power. Inadequacy relieves us of the burden of self-effort and self-reliance, motivating dependency on divine power instead.
We’ll never be adequate until we draw from the Holy Spirit’s inexhaustible strength. He does in and through us what God never intended that we do on our own. By using inadequate people, God demonstrates the great things He can do. There’s no limit to what He can accomplish through someone willing to give Him full control.
Inadequacy challenges our faith. Paul says, “Our adequacy is from God” (2 Cor. 3:5). Those who focus on the reliability of this promise and step out in obedience will grow in faith. Let the Lord make you adequate: Rely upon Him and allow Christ to live in and through you.
