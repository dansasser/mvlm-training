God Blesses Our Obedience
Because God loves us and wants the best for us, we can trust Him wholeheartedly.
Nowadays, when we come across the word sacrifice, we probably think of giving up our time or resources—not killing an animal on an altar, watching its blood pour out, and smelling its flesh burn. But in the Old Testament, that’s what God required for the Israelites’ atonement. Sacrifice provided a way to purify the spiritual stain of sin and restore a right relationship with God.
You’d think the unpleasantness of burnt offerings would have made people hesitate before sinning so that they’d choose obedience instead. But humans have always wrestled with temptation. Just look at Adam and Eve in Genesis 3:1-24. God created a perfect world, free of sin. And yet He knew we’d make mistakes, so He provided a way for us to be right with Him again—through the gift of sacrifice and His Son. Of course, our Father would prefer we didn’t sin in the first place, but He always forgives us when we come before Him with a “broken and contrite heart” (Ps. 51:17 NIV). He loves us and wants the best for us—which includes being spiritually healthy, free, and full of joy.
Jesus told the disciples, “If you love Me, you will keep My commandments” (John 14:15). Let us love and trust God enough to obey Him, keeping our heart and conscience pure and our connection with Him strong.
