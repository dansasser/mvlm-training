Recognizing God’s Handiwork
Ask God to help you know where He is working—and how you can join Him.
The work God does is creative. He made heaven, earth, and all living creatures. He formed Adam and Eve in His image and knitted each of us together in our mother’s womb. His work is also powerful. Through His Son Jesus, He reconciled us to Himself and adopted us into His family. God’s work is ongoing, and Jesus is the One who holds all things together (Colossians 1:17).
In order to recognize God’s handiwork, we need to pray in an active, persistent manner. Christ-centered prayers narrow our focus to the Lord. Then we can more readily identify His actions and see how we are able to join Him in His work.
The Father wants our heart and mind yielded to His will. Pursuing our own agenda shifts the focus to ourselves and makes us lose sight of Him. But a submissive attitude prepares us to listen and obey. Regularly concentrating on God’s Word will clear our mind and help us understand what He is doing. When we combine these disciplines with discernment and patience, we will have positioned ourselves to discover how God is working in our life and in our world.
God is still at work today. Ask the Lord to open your eyes to how He is working around you—and to refocus your heart and mind on Him.
