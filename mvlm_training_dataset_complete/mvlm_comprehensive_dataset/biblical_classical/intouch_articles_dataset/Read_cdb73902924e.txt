Better Than Sacrifice
Each gift, no matter the size, is precious to God if it comes from the heart.
When David wrote Psalm 69, his life wasn’t going well. He was in great distress as relentless adversaries pursued him. His unfiltered song before the Lord included both a lament about his harsh situation and a call for divine justice against his enemies. But as David continued to pour out his heart to God, the tone of his prayer began to shift. Before the psalm ended, his words were expressing gratitude.
David was certain God saw and heard him, and he recognized that gratefulness for such things is of great worth to the Lord. In fact, verses 30-31 say that thanksgiving is even better than material sacrifice in the Lord’s sight.
It can be hard to imagine that God could be more pleased with the offerings of our heart than with the gifts that flow from our finances. But David’s words remind us that God’s economy is not like ours. The true value of the tangible things we offer to Him—whether material goods, time, or talent—have value only as outward expressions of what’s in our heart. In fact, gratitude is the reason for the other gifts we present to our heavenly Father.
