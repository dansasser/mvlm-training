Our mistakes are never the end of the story if we keep going to God with our disappointment.
Pride is dangerous because it hinders our communication with God. It is something that Scripture clearly says the Lord hates (Proverbs 6:16-17; Proverbs 8:13; Proverbs 16:5). So if there is pride in your life, God will want to help remove it. And He might allow you to experience failure as a means to that end.
And that is what happened to Israel in Joshua 7:1-26. The new nation had won a mighty victory in Jericho and became rather prideful. Considering themselves invulnerable, they became disobedient to the One who had delivered them.
In arrogance, a soldier named Achan ignored God’s instructions concerning spoils from the battle of Jericho. Israel then proceeded to the town of Ai, but instead of the easy victory the soldiers expected, they suffered a humiliating defeat. Joshua and the elders of Israel humbly cried out to the Lord, who led them to confront the sin in their midst and then conquer Ai.
If disappointment today leads to great success tomorrow, isn’t the setback worth it? The next time you experience failure, observe your response: Do you throw your hands up in frustration? Do you struggle with inadequacy? Notice your feelings and ask God, “What do You want me to know in this moment?”
