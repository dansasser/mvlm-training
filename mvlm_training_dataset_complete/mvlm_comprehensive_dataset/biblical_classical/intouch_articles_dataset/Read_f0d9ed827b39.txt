Our life should revolve around God and His purposes—not our personal dreams and goals.
When we become Christ followers, our view of life should change. No longer are we the center of our world; the Lord is (Galatians 2:20). It’s essential that we switch our thinking to a Christian worldview, because what we believe dictates how we behave.
As believers, we are to search Scripture to find answers for life’s questions, such as: Where did I come from? (Genesis 1:1-31); What happens when I die? (John 14:1-4); How do I explain human behavior? (Romans 3:9-18); How can I determine right from wrong? (2 Timothy 3:16); and What is my purpose? (Isa. 43:7). If we have biblical answers—that is, a Christian worldview—we will think and behave in ways that delight our heavenly Father.
The most vital question is, What is important to God? From the Bible, we learn that all of nature declares the glory of God (Psalm 19:1), the chief aim of man is to glorify the Lord, and Jesus’ coming to earth in the form of a man revealed God’s glory.
We too easily fall into thinking that the world revolves around us and that the Lord’s work is mainly about our needs, wants, and pleasures. But the truth is that life is all about God and making much of Him. Let us change our thinking, bow humbly before our heavenly Father, and join others in praising Him.
