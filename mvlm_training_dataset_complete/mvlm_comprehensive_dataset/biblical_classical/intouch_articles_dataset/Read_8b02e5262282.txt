Feasting as Wedding Preparation
Communion reminds us that one day we will gather with other believers at a table with Jesus.
1 Corinthians 11:23-26
1 Corinthians 11:23-26
On the night he was betrayed, Jesus celebrated the feast of Passover with His disciples. During their shared meal, the Lord gave His followers a new interpretation of the Passover meal.
By associating the bread and wine with His body and blood, Jesus revealed Himself to be the true Passover lamb who takes away the sins of the world. Communion, also called the Lord’s Supper, has been observed by believers ever since that evening, when Jesus said, “Do this in remembrance of Me” (1 Cor. 11:24).
As we take communion together, we remember Christ’s body and blood, given for us at the cross. But by partaking in this feast, we also think of the future, when sin and death will have been defeated once and for all. Then, at the wedding feast of the Lamb (Revelation 19:9), we’ll celebrate God’s presence and provision in our daily life while also preparing for eternity with Him.
Whether you feel close to or far from God today, know this: Your Creator loves you and invites you to sit at His table in this life and the life to come. His body and blood are the bread and wine that sustain us each day. His feasting table is a place of welcome, remembrance, and celebration. Will you accept His invitation?
