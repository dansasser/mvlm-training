Choose to believe what the Bible teaches: You are precious in God's sight.
Whenever feelings of low self-worth threaten us with discouragement, we need to rely on the truth of God’s Word rather than our emotions. Today we are going to examine four phrases that describe how the Lord sees every believer as a member of ...
A Chosen Race. God chose you and me to be part of His kingdom and family because He loves and wants us.
A Royal Priesthood. As believers, we are children of God and part of a royal family. Jesus fulfilled the roles of king and priest. In a similar way, God has also entrusted us with priestly responsibilities of worship and intercession for others.
A Holy Nation. The church—or body of Christ—is a group of people who are holy, which means “set apart” for the purposes of God.
A People for God’s Own Possession. We are the personal possessions of God. (See Deuteronomy 14:2; Titus 2:14; 1 Pet. 2:9.) Because He sees us as precious, the Father sent His Son to die on the cross in our place so we could belong to Him.
Each of these descriptions shows the high value God places on you. Begin today to demonstrate the truth of Scripture by remembering your real identity and living out your high calling from the Lord.
