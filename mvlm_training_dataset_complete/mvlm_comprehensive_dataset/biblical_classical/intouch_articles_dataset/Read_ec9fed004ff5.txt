Our Savior loves us perfectly because He’s fully God and fully man—powerful and compassionate.
The Nicene Creed succinctly describes our Savior’s two natures—human and divine. It reads: “I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God … true God from true God ... For us men and for our salvation He came down from heaven, and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and became man.”
This fact was universally acknowledged by both angels and human beings (Matthew 16:13-17; Luke 1:26-35; John 11:27). Even the demons knew the truth (Luke 4:40-41)! And it’s important for us to understand as well. If we don’t, our faith will remain immature and we can’t “give an account for the hope that is in [us]” (1 Peter 3:15).
As C. S. Lewis said, “A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic—on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg—or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse ... But let us not come up with any patronising nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us.”
To better understand who Jesus is, spend time in prayer and ask Him to teach you. He’s ready to answer.
