God always hears and responds to His children's cries for help.
We learned yesterday that God is our protector. David’s song in Psalm 121 also portrays the Lord as our keeper.
“He who keeps you will not slumber” (v. 3). Many people are fearful of the dark. But thankfully, our Caretaker needs no sleep. He is always alert and attentive to our cries, even if our feelings tell us otherwise.
“The Lord is your keeper … He will keep your soul” (vv. 5, 7). When parents must leave their children, they put a trusted person in charge to protect and provide for them. How much more invested and capable is our heavenly Father! He preserves us physically and spiritually, allowing only what He knows will be for our good. His Holy Spirit gives warnings to keep us from evil and also provides guidance so we’ll grow in the right direction.
“The Lord will guard your going out and your coming in from this time forth and forever” (v. 8). God is sovereign. He is with us always—protecting, guiding, and teaching. He accompanies and leads, even in the small tasks that seem insignificant.
There’s no place we could go that’s beyond the reach of our loving heavenly Father, who is our keeper. His precious love and watchful eye are constant, and He cares for us better than anyone else ever could.
