The Blessing of Loving Others
We are called to love others as Jesus loves us—even when they are unkind.
If we responded simply out of our natural impulses, we would probably be nice when people were kind to us. At other times, though, we could be angry or hurtful.
Yet Jesus teaches us to love even when those around us are uncivil. He lived out what He taught: Jesus loved us enough to die on the cross for us while we were still sinners (Romans 5:8). Out of gratitude for what He did and in reliance on the Lord’s strength, we—His followers—should love others (1 John 3:14).
While it’s hard to respond to unkindness with love, doing so can lead to blessing—first, because the Father is pleased with us. This should bring us joy, peace, and a sense of contentment. We also ought to feel excitement and anticipation to watch how the Lord will honor our obedience. And finally, we’ll have an awareness that the Holy Spirit is working from within, enabling divine love to flow through lives that are yielded to Him.
John 13:35 tells of an important benefit: Jesus said, “By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.” Treating others as we want to be treated is what builds the deep, satisfying connections all people desire. So think about the people you come in contact with throughout the week and treat them the way Jesus would—with love.
