The Treasure of Faith
Spiritual legacies begin with God’s faithful ones—will others learn of Christ through you?
Where does faith come from? It’s a gift of God, ultimately, but the Bible repeatedly points to the value of a faithful life. One example is the apostle Paul’s disciple, Timothy, whose mother and grandmother were strong role models of faith.
We know nothing of Lois or Eunice beyond the mention of them in 2 Timothy 1:5. They are probably the reason the young minister had known “the sacred writings” of Scripture all his life—from these devout women, in other words, he had received “the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus” (2 Timothy 3:15).
But what about those of us without a legacy like Timothy’s? Paul spoke to that as well, saying that God “saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace” (1:9).
Like Timothy, those of us with godly parents enjoy the fruit of their faithfulness. But if you’re the first believer in your family, then you’re creating the legacy of faithfulness for future generations. That’s what Paul charges Timothy to protect and “entrust … to faithful people” (2 Timothy 2:2). And it’s our charge, too. If we guard and pass down this treasure, our loved ones will, by God’s grace, continue the tradition of faith.
