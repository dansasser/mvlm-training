Things That Can Be Shaken
In Jesus, we have salvation, security, and steadfast love.
God has ways of shaking the world when He is up to something big. He literally caused the ground to quake when Jesus died on the cross and after Pentecost (Matthew 27:51; Acts 4:31). These were none-too-subtle messages which meant, Pay attention because important things are happening!
Today, the ground may not be physically moving, but the Lord is certainly doing some shaking. People too often build their lives on the weak cornerstones of their human wisdom, goodness, and ingenuity. But there is only one secure foundation: Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 3:11).
God always has a purpose for permitting upheaval in His ordered creation. Among other things, He is shaking the church out of its apathy and self-focus, reminding believers not to trust in the temporary structures of this world. Rather, we are to rest upon the safe and firm foundation provided by God’s steadfast love, salvation, and kingdom, which is present here and now.
As the Lord’s ambassadors on earth—and the only ones standing on firm ground—we have a responsibility to offer real hope to those whose foundation has become unstable. No job, government, or even religion can give a person long-term security. A relationship with Jesus Christ is the only lasting refuge.
