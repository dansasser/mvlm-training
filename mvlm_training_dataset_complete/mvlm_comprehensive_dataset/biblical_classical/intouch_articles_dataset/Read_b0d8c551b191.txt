Fellowship in the Spirit
Are you experiencing deep connection with other believers and participating in God's work on earth?
Most churches have a fellowship hall—a space where members gather for all kinds of events other than worship services. Getting out of the pew and interacting with our brothers and sisters in Christ fosters a deep sense of community.
Paul describes this kind of togetherness as “being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose” (Philippians 2:2). Our Bibles usually translate it as “fellowship of the Spirit” (Philippians 2:1).
But today, the word fellowship has lost some of its original impact. To recapture what it was meant to convey, let’s examine the word Paul uses in that verse. The Greek term koinonia means what we use the English word fellowship to express—that is, connection and camaraderie with others.
What’s more, koinonia carries a sense of participation in what God is doing. This seems reasonable, given that the church and its members are Christ’s body (Romans 12:5; 1 Corinthians 12:27). Together, we enjoy His life and love in certain ways that we understand—and in others we don’t fully grasp yet. Remembering our fellowship in the Spirit can help bring about unity in the family of faith. How can you foster this kind of fellowship in your own church and friendships?
