Inseparable From Christ
Nothing, not even the choices we ourselves make, can stop God from loving us.
In times of pain and adversity, we might feel as if God has abandoned us. If He were here, we think, He would have done something by now. However, today’s passage says that nothing can separate us from Christ’s love:
Not events. There isn’t any circumstance—no matter how bad—that can remove us from divine love. In fact, we can “conquer through Him who love[s] us” (Rom. 8:35-37), and our hardships will only help to transform us into Christ’s image (v. 29).
Not time. Nothing we have gone through in the past, deal with today, or encounter in the future can take us away from Christ (vv. 37-38). He is with us always (Matthew 28:20).
Not power. No evil entity that tries to deceive us is a match for the Lord, who holds us securely in His grasp (Rom. 8:38-39).
Not any created thing. God is self-existent, and if He calls you His own, nothing and no one—not even you—can break that relationship (v. 39).
Hardships aren’t an indication that God has forgotten about us; they’re simply part of our life on earth. Remember, your Father is with you even when it doesn’t feel like it. He has “inscribed you on the palms of [His] hands” (Isaiah 49:16).
