Focus determines the trajectory of the mind and heart. So turn your eyes toward Jesus.
Mosaics are among the oldest and most beautiful forms of art. The process involves arranging glass tiles or small pieces of stone to create pictures or patterns. Some of these are quite elaborate, and to take in the full image, we must stand back and observe from a distance. If we step closer, we’ll instead see the individual glass or stone components. In other words, where we fix our eyes determines what we see.
How often, as we are growing in faith, do we experience something similar? During hardship, we tend to zoom in on the small pebble of our circumstances and often miss the bigger picture of God’s work.
Consider what might happen if we shifted our focus. In today’s passage from Hebrews, that’s just what the author encourages us to do—by looking to Jesus. Our Savior didn’t just endure the opposition of man and the shame of the cross; He overcame with joy. When we look to Him, our hearts will be strengthened and encouraged.
So let’s practice stepping back from the details of our trials and gazing at the author and finisher of our faith (Heb. 12:2). Then we will see a different image—one of gladness and victory.
