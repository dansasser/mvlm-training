Falling in Love With Jesus
Consistently spending time with the Lord brings joy to the believer.
When we fall in love, we want to spend time with the object of our affection. Falling in love with Jesus should be no different, but believers will often hurry through Bible reading and prayer. The result is a superficial faith kept alive by habit rather than worship. To attain lasting intimacy, we must approach the Lord with a sense of ...
Purpose: King David advised the leaders of Israel, “Set your heart and your soul to seek the Lord your God” (1 Chronicles 22:19). Likewise, if we desire intimacy with the Lord, we should approach spiritual disciplines intentionally. Before opening Scripture, for example, we can ask God what He wants to say to us. We can also pray to understand His ways—He loves answering that request.
Determination: Isaiah told Yahweh, “Indeed, my spirit within me seeks You diligently” (Isaiah 26:9). Even when we might not feel like putting time into our relationship with Christ, we must determine to do so. Those who diligently seek the Savior experience His presence frequently in their worship.
Getting to know Jesus brings pure joy into a believer’s life. Giving God attention and spending time with Him are ways to show the Lord we love Him. God gives us His best; we should put forth no less in return.
