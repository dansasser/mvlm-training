Fighting the Battle Against Sin
To resist temptation, spend time regularly in God's Word.
1 Corinthians 10:1-13
1 Corinthians 10:1-13
God established protective boundaries for His children because He knows the dangers of disobedience. His Word warns us not to give in to temptation but to follow Jesus Christ in a life of sacrifice.
In contrast, the world says satisfaction is found in wealth, status, and friends. Satan’s goal of turning us away from God started with his temptation of Adam and Eve. The Creator had given them access to every tree in the Garden of Eden except one. The first man and woman stepped outside the limit set by the Lord, ate the forbidden fruit, and became separated from Him. Satan used doubt (“Has God said?”), deceit (“You surely will not die”), and self-delusion (“You will be like God”) to achieve his aim (Genesis 3:1-5). He made rebellion against God—which is the root of all sin—seem very attractive. And the Enemy’s methods are the same today.
Thankfully, by immersing ourselves in Scripture, we can learn to resist when tempted. We must focus our attention on knowing God, believing His promises, and following His commands. Only through our relationship with Jesus Christ will we be able to endure in the face of temptation and obey the Lord (1 Cor. 10:13).
