When believers choose to meet the needs of others, God is glorified and we are blessed.
2 Corinthians 9:10-12
Do you realize that for believers, many needs can and should be met within the church? To make this possible, however, Christians must give of themselves on behalf of others (2 Corinthians 9:10-12).
For example, a man determines to offer support and pray alongside a hurting brother. Or a woman makes herself available to answer a new Christian’s questions about the weekly sermon—the two ladies search the Bible and fill their minds with Scripture. And there are countless other ways to serve, such as driving an elderly member to the service, teaching a Sunday school class, or delivering a meal and spending time with someone.
Before you become overwhelmed by what a variety of needs there are, remember that loving one another is a body-wide effort; one person cannot offer help for all situations. But suppose you commit to serving a few folks whom God brings into your sphere of influence. As you surrender to the Lord, He will bless you with joy and profound contentment.
To put others before yourself is to practice authentic Christianity. And if believers commit to meeting as many needs as the Lord brings to their attention, a church can be transformed, becoming a true body of believers who function together for the glory of God.
