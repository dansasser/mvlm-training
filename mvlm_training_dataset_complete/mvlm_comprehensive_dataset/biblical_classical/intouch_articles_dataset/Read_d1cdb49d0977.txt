Don't let fear keep you from wholeheartedly serving God.
God has prepared work He wants us to do, and as His children, we should excitedly—and promptly—do what He calls us to accomplish in His name. But at times we hesitate. Things like Bible reading, praying, and tithing might come to mind, but these aren’t the only things believers can put off. We might also delay:
Serving in the church. 1 Peter 4:10 says we should “employ [our gifts] in serving one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.” If we examine ourselves, we might find we dodge what we are scared of or feel inadequate to do.
Sharing our faith. We can get anxious about how to express ourselves, what reaction we’ll get, and whether we’ll be able to answer questions adequately. But we’re responsible only for planting the seed; the Lord will take care of its growth (1 Corinthians 3:6-9).
Surrendering our will to the Lord’s. Just thinking about giving God control in certain areas makes many of us feel fearful. But true submission says, “Lord, I am willing to do whatever You want in this situation. I will obey Your Word.”
The Lord has asked us to be His ambassadors—to represent Him to a hurting world (2 Corinthians 5:20). Therefore, we should make every effort to act without hesitation. Which areas of your life does this bring to mind?
