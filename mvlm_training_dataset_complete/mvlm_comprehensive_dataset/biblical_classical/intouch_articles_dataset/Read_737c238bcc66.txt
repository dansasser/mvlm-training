Certainty About Salvation
Are you experiencing doubt about your relationship with God? Trust the truth of the Word and be confident.
God gave us the Bible so we could know Him and live in a way that brings Him glory. He desires that we truly understand His teachings and how they apply to our life. Simply put, the Lord wants us to trust in Him with complete confidence.
There are forces at work, however, that attempt to undermine our confidence. Many of us know what it’s like to be joyfully moving along through life, sure of salvation—until we stumble into sin. Then feelings can take over, causing us to think, There’s no way I can be saved. If I were truly saved, I’d never have done such a thing. Overwhelmed by a sense of regret and shame, we find our faith coming under fire.
Yet the Lord wants us to operate on the basis of truth, not feelings (John 16:13). Whenever your emotions contradict the Bible, you can be sure that the Scriptures are reliable.
Have your feelings of regret stolen your confidence in eternal salvation? In today’s passage, John says, “I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life” (1 John 5:13, emphasis added). Lay your feelings before the Lord today, and embrace the certainty that comes only with His truth.
