Where Do You Go for Advice?
There are many sources of information available, but only Scripture is always true.
Our thinking shapes what we believe, and beliefs in turn determine our lifestyle. Therefore, a biblical mindset is essential to our sanctification.
Where do you go when you want advice about a big decision or lifestyle choice? Websites, social media, and streaming services offer a wealth of information that can be either beneficial or harmful. Coworkers, family, and friends are also readily available sources of counsel, but do they speak with godly wisdom? Our only sure resource for true and wise guidance is Scripture.
In Hebrews 4:12, God’s Word is described as “living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword”—something that pierces into the deepest parts of the soul. Those who refuse to heed its guidance lose out on the invaluable direction and reassurance it provides. But those who are willing to be nourished by Scripture, accepting its reproof and correction, will discover the riches of a life of faith.
Letting the Word be your guide requires changes in thought, attitude, and behavior. Yet any lifestyle adjustments or disciplines that produce godliness also result in eternal profit. A solid foundation of faith and wisdom always includes going to Scripture for direction.
