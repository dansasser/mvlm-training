Prayer in the Believer’s Life
Spending time in communication with God is the best way to grow close to Him.
One of the most important disciplines in the life of a believer is prayer. It is the means by which we move into deep and cherished fellowship with God.
When we pray, we’re simply talking to the Lord and trusting that He will answer. In doing so, we learn to listen and wait for His response. And He loves for us to honor Him through this spiritual act of worship.
Indeed, prayer is one of the best ways to honor God. When we pray to our heavenly Father, we are acknowledging that He is God, “the high and exalted One who lives forever, whose name is Holy” (Isa. 57:15). God alone deserves glory, and we honor Him when we “pray without ceasing” (1 Thessalonians 5:17). That is, we are to maintain a God-focused attitude throughout the day—continually asking Him to govern every detail of our life.
In today’s passage, God says, “I dwell on a high and holy place, and also with the contrite and lowly of spirit” (v. 15). This means that our motives and the condition of our heart are very important in prayer.
The heavenly Father longs for an intimate relationship with His children. Time spent in communication with Him is the best way to develop that closeness.
