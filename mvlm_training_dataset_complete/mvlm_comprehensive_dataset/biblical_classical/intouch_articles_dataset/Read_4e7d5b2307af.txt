When we are weak and cannot pray, the Holy Spirit intercedes for us.
1 Thessalonians 5:16-19
1 Thessalonians 5:16-19
One of the most painful human emotions is loneliness. Of course, there are times when being alone is unavoidable. But since God has sent His Spirit to live within us, we are never truly on our own. The Holy Spirit—whom Jesus referred to as our “Helper” (John 14:26)—is with us every second of every day.
Let’s think about ways that the Spirit of God helps us in our prayer life. First, He prods us to pray. Have you ever felt a strong sense that you needed to spend time with the Lord—perhaps without even knowing why? That is the Spirit convicting you. He has many reasons for doing this: He knows when we need strength because of an imminent difficulty. Or He sometimes encourages us to confess sin so our fellowship with the Father isn’t hindered.
Second, the Holy Spirit intercedes for us. There are times when we do not know how to pray—for example, when sorrow or helplessness overwhelms us to the point that words are impossible to speak, even to the Lord. Thankfully, when all we can do is cry to Jesus, the Spirit will lead on our behalf.
What a privilege to have God’s Spirit dwelling in your heart. Do you recognize His power and love throughout your day? He longs to comfort, enable, and guide you each and every moment.
