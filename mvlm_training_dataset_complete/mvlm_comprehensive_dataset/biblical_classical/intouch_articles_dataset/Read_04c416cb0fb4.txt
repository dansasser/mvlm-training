Let’s begin the new year praying God’s best for those around us.
A new year stretching out before us promises endless opportunities to improve, to be better people. Many of our New Year’s resolutions—to read more, stick to a budget, or be more physically active, for example—express an inward focus. But what if we resolved to begin the year by turning our attention outward?
In today’s passage, the apostle Paul prays that the Ephesians would know God. That seems strange since they were already following Christ, but Paul knew the importance of truly, intimately knowing the Lord. It is, as Jesus told His disciples, the substance of eternal life (John 17:3). So Paul prayed their hearts would be enlightened as they gained spiritual wisdom and insight about the “mystery” of the gospel (Ephesians 1:9).
Paul understood that “His body” (v. 23) meant Jews and Gentiles alike, and he wanted to make sure the Ephesians—who were Gentiles—understood that, too. So he prayed for them to see and understand God’s work in their lives and community—both in “this age” and “the one to come” (v. 21).
This year, let’s allow Paul’s words to guide us as we pray for our own communities—that a spirit of wisdom and revelation would deepen their knowledge of God and their experience of eternal life in Christ.
