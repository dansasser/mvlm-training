If you don't know what to do, just be faithful where you are.
Micah’s prophecy to the people of Judah sounded bleak: The nation had fallen into idolatry and other sins and as a result would face God’s judgment of suffering and exile. (See Micah 1-3.)
But in chapter 4, the book’s tone changes abruptly, and Micah is left with what we might call “waiting words”—a common feature in biblical prophecy. These are phrases that encourage Israel to be faithful even when hope seems lost. In the first verse of today’s passage, the waiting words are “It will come about,” sometimes translated as “It shall come to pass.” God asks Israel not merely to wait—but to wait in faith. How does Micah reconcile this hope with reality?
From that point on, the book takes on a more hopeful tone as God shows Micah what will come later: The Lord will restore and revive the nation, providing peace and healing. In addition, He promises the appearance of their Messiah, a shepherd-king who “will arise and shepherd His flock in the strength of the lord” (Micah 5:4).
Micah’s words near the end of the book capture his prayerful posture: “I will be on the watch for the lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me” (Micah 7:7). Watching for the Lord, looking to Him alone, and expecting Him to hear us is the right stance when things seem bleak.
