If we turn to God with our weaknesses, His limitless strength can be ours.
Success is often hard to define.  We generally equate it with fame, money, and power. If these were the most accurate ways to measure, however, we could never call the apostle Paul “successful.”
Was he famous? He’d been a rising star of a Jewish leader but with believers was infamous and seen as a notorious troublemaker.
Was he wealthy? As a talented tentmaker, he most likely was well-off. However, when Jesus Christ called him to spread the gospel to the world, his financial status changed quickly. He lived the rest of his life as an itinerant preacher, supporting himself on missionary journeys by practicing his trade.
Was he powerful? In the eyes of the world, Paul was simply a strange, brash preacher of a new gospel. He was in and out of prison, often at odds with those around him, and dealing with an unspecified affliction (2 Corinthians 12:7).
In his own strength, Paul was just as weak as any other man. However, he had access to the most amazing power the world had ever known: Jesus Christ. That’s why, in the face of weakness, the apostle could exclaim, “I can do all things through Him who strengthens me” (Philippians 4:13). And that very same power is available to us today, so no matter what challenges we face, we can experience success God’s way.
