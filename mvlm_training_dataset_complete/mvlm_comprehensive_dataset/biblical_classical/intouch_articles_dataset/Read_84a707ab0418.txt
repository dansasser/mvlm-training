Every day we have the privilege of drawing closer to God through His Word.
Throughout the world, and even within the church, there’s a wide range of beliefs about the Lord. It’s important for believers to recognize that the Bible is without error and that it reveals the truth we need to understand about our triune God (John 17:17).
The inerrancy of the Bible. Without a firm belief in this doctrine, all of a person’s ideas about the Lord will be subjective. Scripture is the compilation of God’s thoughts written without error by men who were governed by the Holy Spirit (2 Pet. 1:20-21).
An accurate understanding of the Lord. God is one divine being expressed in three eternal persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. They are equal in every way, but their jobs differ. All three were involved in creation as well as in the plan of salvation.
The Son came to earth through a virgin birth. He lived a perfect life, died a sacrificial death for our sins, rose from the grave, and ascended to the Father in heaven. The Holy Spirit is our source of power. He indwells every believer in Christ, transforming character, revealing truth, and enabling obedience to God.
Our Creator wants us to know Him. Isn’t that amazing? He invites us to enjoy an intimate relationship with Him. Every day we have the privilege of opening His Word and having a heart-to-heart conversation with our triune God.
