Building Bridges of Love
With the Lord’s power, it’s possible to overlook offenses and instead respond with kindness and forgiveness.
Since we all have a basic need for unity and connection, today’s scripture is likely to resonate deeply. Calling us to be “harmonious, sympathetic, loving, compassionate, and humble,” these two verses urge us to bless others instead of insulting them or “returning evil for evil.” The passage is an invitation to build bridges of love and understanding in a world that often seems divided.
A few days ago we spoke about faith as a bridge connecting us with God’s promises. Today, let’s use another bridge analogy, this time picturing your life as a way to connect with others by rising above misunderstanding and resentment. Your humility and kindness form pillars that support this bridge. So when others hurl insults, resolve not to retaliate; offering a blessing instead can lead to connection and reconciliation.
Building bridges means choosing love over hatred, forgiveness over resentment, and kindness over cruelty. Our purpose as Christians isn’t to prevail in conflicts but to inherit God’s blessings and extend them to others. So let’s aim to reflect His love and bring healing and unity to those around us.
