Peace in the Stillness
If you are feeling overwhelmed today, spend some time with your heavenly Father to find serenity.
Think about the last time you walked into an arcade or theme park. What was the experience like? Probably a thousand things vied for your attention, including bright flashing lights, cacophonous music, and crowded walkways. In all likelihood, it was hard to focus (and impossible to have a conversation).
Everyday life can also feel like that sometimes—too much input and not enough time to process everything that’s going on. It’s no wonder that we struggle to hear the Lord’s “still small voice” (1 Kings 19:12 KJV) in all of it! Jesus faced this same problem, which is why He made sure to get away and spend time with His Father (Mark 1:35).
Psalm 46:10 calls us to stillness: “Stop striving and know that I am God.” To enjoy this continuous inner peace, we must periodically pause everything and let our soul become aware of the Holy Spirit’s presence. In today’s reading, David described it as being like a “weaned child” at perfect rest in his mother’s arms.
Intentionally slowing down can be difficult to do, but experiencing the serenity and rest God provides is a gift well worth seeking.
