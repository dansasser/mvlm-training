God's Word helps us clearly see where we are—and where we need to go.
Look at a light pollution map on the International Dark-Sky Association’s website, and you’ll quickly see how difficult it is to find complete darkness. But in the premodern world, people spent much more time in darkness. So today’s promise—that the Word can be a lamp and a light—would have had far greater impact before the advent of electricity.
God’s future kingdom is light-filled—“its lamp is the Lamb” (Revelation 21:23). As dim as our world sometimes seems, we need God’s light both to understand where we are and to see where we’re going. That dual sense is present in today’s passage.
God’s Word is a “lamp to [our] feet.” A lamp illuminates the area around it. Likewise, the Bible is essential for seeing and interpreting our emotions, relationships, and circumstances. Our own perceptions may be incomplete or unreliable, but the lamp of God’s Word reveals everything.
We also, however, want to move forward. The Word shines a light on the path, showing us where we’re headed. With God’s help, we may move in discernment, using the “wisdom from above” (James 3:17).
Whether you face difficult circumstances or have a decision to make, let the Word serve as a lamp and a light. You can trust God to help you see more clearly and move ahead without fear.
