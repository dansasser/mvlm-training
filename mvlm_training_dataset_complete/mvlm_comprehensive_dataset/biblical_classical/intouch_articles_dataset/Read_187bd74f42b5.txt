Comforting Those Who Grieve
Those who mourn are all around us; may we offer them the compassion of our Savior.
Like Tamar and Rahab, the fourth woman in Matthew’s genealogy has a tarnished reputation (Matthew 1:6)—Bathsheba is labeled by some as a temptress. In reality, however, she was a victim. Desired by King David, she was brought to him and soon found herself pregnant and in danger of death for adultery. David tried to cover up his sin by manipulating Bathsheba’s husband Uriah. When that didn’t work, David had him killed at the front.
Suddenly, Bathsheba was a grieving widow. “She mourned for her husband,” according to 2 Samuel 11:26. Then David made her his wife. When she delivered a son, her joy was short-lived. The child became sick and died, as the prophet Nathan had prophesied (2 Samuel 12:14). Now she was grieving two great losses: a husband and a child.
When it comes to our attention that a parent is grieving, we may feel unsure of the best way to reach out. But we have Jesus as a model of how to offer care. Matthew saw his Master heal the multitudes and remembered the words of Isaiah: “A bent reed He will not break off, and a dimly burning wick He will not extinguish” (Matthew 12:20). May we receive such people with gentleness and be a safe place that promotes their healing.
