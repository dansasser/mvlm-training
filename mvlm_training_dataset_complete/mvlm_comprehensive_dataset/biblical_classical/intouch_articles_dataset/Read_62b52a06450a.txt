Choose to seek God's viewpoint by reading the Bible and following the Holy Spirit's guidance.
Believers are to walk by faith, according to 2 Corinthians 5:7. However, we sometimes struggle to hear and apply God’s wisdom. For example, we’re called to forgive each other, but that can be difficult when we’ve been hurt (Ephesians 4:32).
Godly wisdom is the capacity to view things as the Lord does and to respond according to biblical principles. This discernment isn’t automatic. Yes, God’s Spirit lives inside believers to guide us, but each individual chooses whether to pursue the wise way.
If a person is going to walk wisely, he or she must commit to pursuing Christ. Resolving to honor the Lord transforms the way we make decisions. Instead of following instincts or impulses, we choose to seek God’s viewpoint in a given situation, searching Scripture and listening for the Holy Spirit. As a result, the Spirit’s quiet voice becomes easier to discern, and those worldly shouts fade.
You have a loving heavenly Father who honors the heartfelt commitment to walk according to His will. God assumes responsibility for offering His children sought-after wisdom and enabling them to keep walking on the right path. That’s why following Him is always the best decision.
