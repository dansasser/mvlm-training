Formula for Personal Growth
As you read the Bible today, ask God to show you how to live the truth He reveals.
Growing in Christ involves more than just attending church, tithing, and listening to sermons. There are two necessary elements: instruction and involvement.
Our Savior proved the importance of instruction by devoting much of His time to it. And the apostle Paul wrote many letters to educate Christians about godliness. For every believer, learning truth is vital to a healthy walk with God.
So how can we gain knowledge and understanding? One of the most effective ways is to read the Word of God. Scripture instructs us that just as newborns crave milk, we are to desire His Word so that we might grow.
Yet simply listening to the truth does not mean that we’ve acquired it. We have to apply the Word to our life. Even so, actual growth requires more than merely inputting information—it requires action. James 2:26 states, “For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.”
Are we listening intently and abiding in the truth? If we’re truly maturing, our life will be increasingly Christlike, and our desires will align more closely with God’s heart.
