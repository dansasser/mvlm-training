We find complete joy and fulfillment in the presence of the Lord.
God created us to be in relationship with Him. The type of communion Adam and Eve enjoyed with Him is meant for us as well. But when sin entered the world, everything changed. God’s relationship with mankind was broken.
But as we know, that’s not the end of the story. Jesus came to die in our place, bringing forgiveness for our sins and restoring our relationship with God. We are adopted into God’s family and belong to Him forever. He has provided us with everything we need in order to experience intimacy with Him.
So what happens if, following salvation, new believers never go deeper? Some may drift away from their initial zeal for the Lord. Perhaps others try to focus on God but allow earthly matters to distract them. Over time, some Christians settle for what’s comfortable and familiar. Sadly, they will miss out on the deep contentment God wanted to provide. Yet those who follow Jesus wholeheartedly will have a deepening relationship with Him.
Communion with God made King David “fully satisfied as with the richest of foods” (Ps. 63:5 NIV). And Paul viewed his own accomplishments as nothing in comparison with “the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus” (Phil. 3:8). Draw near to God and experience the blessings of knowing Him.
