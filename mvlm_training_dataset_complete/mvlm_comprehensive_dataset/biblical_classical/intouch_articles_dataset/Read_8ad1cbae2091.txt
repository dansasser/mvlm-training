Hope Fuels Perseverance
Look beyond today’s hardship and trust the Lord, who is working for your good.
Pain can serve as a warning that something in the body is wrong. After a physical injury or surgery, however, discomfort is often part of the journey toward recovery. At such times, many people might be tempted to let pain keep them from working through the rehabilitation process to regain strength and mobility. For that reason, physical therapists will frequently challenge their patients to push just past their comfort zone. They know that a good outcome depends on more than enduring pain once or twice and then quitting before recovery is complete.
Successful rehab is dependent on the patient’s hope in a better future—in other words, they must look beyond their uncomfortable or painful present circumstances.
Isaiah recognized that even strong young people have limitations (40:30). They run out of energy. They stumble. In contrast, the prophet noted that God never grows tired, nor are there limits to His insight (v. 28). Understanding our weariness, He calls us to wait for Him (v. 31). At the same time, our Father realizes waiting can be even more spiritually and emotionally uncomfortable than trying to push through exhaustion in our own strength. But hope and trust in Him can help us to persevere and, over time, grow in ways we never imagined.
