Knowing God as Our Father
Believers have access to a perfect Parent who offers unlimited love and compassion.
When you hear the word “father,” what images come to mind—someone gentle, stern, available, absent? Regardless of the strengths and weaknesses of our own dads, we have a heavenly Father who is perfect.
If a perfect dad is hard for you to imagine, look at Jesus’ life. He Himself is a picture of God the Father. In Scripture, we see Jesus tenderly holding children, ministering to the sick, and showing compassion to the undeserving. Furthermore, He testifies of a heavenly Father who loves unconditionally, listens to prayers, and freely offers forgiveness.
The good news is that anyone who has been spiritually born into God’s family can call Him “Father.” This rebirth (John 3:3) takes place when a person accepts that Jesus bore his or her sins on the cross. In fact, the Savior’s goal in coming to earth was to reconcile us to God the Father so we could dwell in His family forever.
No matter what your dad is like, the heavenly Father is personally interested and involved in your life. He knows your needs, promises His best for you, and doesn’t hold your mistakes against you. With Him, you will find intimacy, security, and satisfaction. How do you want to respond to your Father today?
