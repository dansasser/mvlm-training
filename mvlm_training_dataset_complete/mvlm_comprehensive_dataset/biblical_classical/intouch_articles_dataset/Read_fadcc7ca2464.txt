God notices every time we love and serve others—and promises to reward us accordingly.
God freely gives salvation to those who believe that Jesus died on the cross for their sins. We cannot earn this gift, nor do we deserve it. Our Father does notice our good works, though, and He promises to reward us accordingly. Genuine service occurs when we cooperate as the Lord works through us for His glory and honor. True ministry takes place when divine resources meet human needs through loving channels.
In Revelation 22:12, the Lord reminds us, “I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to render to every man according to what he has done.” Whether large or small, service done in Jesus’ name will be blessed.
While some rewards will be given in heaven, other blessings can be experienced here on earth. For example, we know great joy when God blesses others through us. And there is deep satisfaction in realizing that we are pleasing Christ. In addition, there’s a profound sense of fulfillment when we lead a person to Jesus and teach him or her how to walk by faith.
Serving others is both a benefit and responsibility for Christians. We should prayerfully make sure that our goal is to glorify Christ. Only then will we receive God’s full blessings—rewards given not only in eternity but also here on earth.
