Nothing Can Separate Us
Nothing, not even our own mistakes, can separate us from the love of God.
1 Corinthians 3:12-15
In Romans 8, Paul delivers a persuasive argument for believing in eternal security, and it’s framed with these questions:
Who will bring a charge against God’s elect? The answer is simple: No one can bring an accusation against believers and make it stick. Satan tries, but God has justified us through Jesus—He’s declared that we are not guilty. If you fall into a stage of unbelief or sinful living, you may lose your reward, but you can’t lose your eternity in heaven with God (1 Corinthians 3:12-15).
Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Undoubtedly, there are many experiences that test our faith, but we are ultimately saved by God’s grace. Jesus understands our trials and doubts, and He is not interested in casting us away at our first misstep. God always knew we would make thousands of mistakes after receiving Christ, but He saved us anyway.
Some followers of Jesus worry that embracing the idea of eternal security will motivate people to go out and live a life of sin because they have nothing to lose. If we think about the wonder and majesty of our Father, doesn’t it make more sense that people would be motivated to praise Him for saving them from their disobedience? The more we know of Jesus and His love for us, the more we will love Him and want to please Him.
