Living in God’s Calling
God has placed you right where you are to do His will.
Esther 3:13; Esther 4:4-16
Knowing that we have a calling from God is one thing, but living it out is another. Esther reached a point in her life when fulfilling God’s plan became risky. The Lord had placed her in a position of influence, but using that power could cost her life.
Few are called to be rulers, but we have all been given places of influence to one degree or another. The Lord has placed you in your family, community, and church to fulfill His purposes for your life in this generation (Psalms 139:15-17). As long as you are breathing, He is still working out His will for you.
How should you respond to His calling? There are only two options: Cooperate by submitting to His plan, or resist Him. Eventually, every Christian is going to encounter a situation that tests his or her willingness to obey God. When that time comes, remember the lesson from Esther. Maybe you have been placed in a difficult situation “for such a time as this” (Est. 4:14)—to be an influence for Christ in our dark world.
Living in God’s calling may not be easy, but it is always worth the risk. Each step will reveal the faithfulness of our Lord, encouraging us to trust Him in the next opportunity He provides. As our faith grows, His perfect timing will become evident, and we’ll look with joy and expectation for what awaits us.
