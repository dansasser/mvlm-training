God’s Gift of Forgiveness
Showing mercy is God's will for us—is there anyone you need to pardon today?
Motivated by love, God provided a way for our sins to be forgiven: He sent Jesus to be our Savior. When we trust in the Lord’s substitutionary sacrifice on our behalf, we receive the gift of forgiveness.
Before placing our faith in Christ, we were dead in our sins and objects of divine wrath (Ephesians 2:1-3). However, our merciful heavenly Father sent His Son to redeem us. At the cross, Jesus took our sins upon Himself and experienced God’s fury for our sake. We are saved by grace—through faith in Christ and what He accomplished (Ephesians 2:8-9). Our salvation is a free gift from the Father.
God’s will is that we forgive, just as we were forgiven. But the human tendency is to attach conditions when extending mercy. We think, I will forgive you only if you apologize. Or, You must make restitution before I will let this go. That’s not what our Savior did. Romans 5:8 tells us: “But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.”
Depending on how much hurt we’ve experienced, we may require time and healing before we can fully forgive. But we are to remember that showing mercy is God’s will. We’re called to pardon those who have caused us pain. Through reliance on God’s Spirit, we can become Christlike and forgive.
