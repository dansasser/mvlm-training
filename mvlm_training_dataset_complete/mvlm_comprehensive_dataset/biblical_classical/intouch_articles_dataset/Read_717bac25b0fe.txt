Because of Jesus, we have an eternal home in heaven and help for everything we face now.
Hope can be defined as the expectation and desire for something good. And Jesus is the greatest source of hope—He alone always knows what’s best and has the power to secure its fulfillment.
When life on earth is like a storm-tossed sea, Christ—our anchor—encourages us with the promise of an imperishable inheritance in heaven (1 Pet. 1:3-4). Yet that ultimate security can seem far away when pain is present and there’s no relief in sight. So how do we endure trials here and now? One way is through hope, which anticipates a change of circumstances for the better.
But what about those times when our situation isn’t improving—then what is God doing that’s “better”? Peter tells us He is refining our faith, which will result in praise and glory when Jesus returns (vv. 6-7). This will prove more valuable than gold or even relief from our distress. The difficulties that cause some to lose hope are the very tools God can use to increase His children’s faith in Him.
Christ promises us hope not only for eternity but also for this life. If God does not deliver us from difficulty, we can rest in the knowledge that He is doing a greater work. When we finally reach our eternal home, we’ll see the immeasurable value of the faith He produced in us as we continued to trust in Him.
