The Powerful Practice of Fasting
Fasting helps us center our attention on the Lord and discover His will.
Nehemiah’s brother arrived from Judah with some bad news: The Israelites living in Jerusalem were in great trouble. Grieving, Nehemiah fasted and prayed for days and ultimately felt led to ask the king of Persia for help.
Fasting is a spiritual discipline that helps us center our attention on the Lord and discover His will so we may act according to it. People fast in different ways: Some abstain from food while others refrain from various activities. The period of time can vary as well. But the focus in each case is to seek God and discern His will.
When we fast, several things happen. First, the Holy Spirit enables us to set aside earthly matters. Second, our attention will shift from ourselves to the Lord. Our thinking will become clearer, and our ability to understand His plans will sharpen because we are not distracted by other things. Third, the Lord will convict us of sinful attitudes or behaviors. Then, upon confession of our sin, we’ll be forgiven and cleansed (James 5:16).
When unexpected news greets us, we—like Nehemiah—may find our emotions in turmoil. He wisely sought God through fasting and prayer. And so can we. Ask to hear clearly from the Lord, who knows the best way through every situation.
