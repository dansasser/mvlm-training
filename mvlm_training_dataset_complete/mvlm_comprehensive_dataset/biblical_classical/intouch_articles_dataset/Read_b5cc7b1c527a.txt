The Role of Our Conscience
The Lord has provided all we need in order to make wise choices.
The Lord gives each of us a conscience to help us distinguish between right and wrong. In a believer, the conscience is a tool of the Holy Spirit; He fills and matures it with principles from God’s Word and sharpens it to respond quickly.
The purpose of the conscience is to send a signal when a decision must be made. What happens next is up to us. Either we ignore the warning or we stop to hear what the Spirit has to say about the situation. The Holy Spirit reveals God’s will or reminds us of His principles so we can make a wise choice.
In his letter to Timothy, Paul mentioned people who had rejected God’s leadership and guidance, resulting in shipwrecked faith (1 Tim. 1:19). When we’re tempted to be disobedient to God, something nudges our conscience, and we must choose to reject the misstep. Otherwise, our sense of right and wrong becomes impaired. If we keep ignoring the warning, the “alarm” will eventually go silent.
We all know people who have “run aground” in life. A shipwrecked faith is inevitable when believers ignore their conscience and rationalize or defend disobedience. It’s far better to trust the great captain of your soul, Jesus Christ. His Holy Spirit will guide you correctly.
