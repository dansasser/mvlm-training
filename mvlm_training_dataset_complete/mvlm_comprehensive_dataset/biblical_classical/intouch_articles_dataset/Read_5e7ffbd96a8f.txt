Living Under Jesus’ Lordship
Deciding to follow Jesus brings joy, peace, protection, and purpose to our life.
Jesus has been given the name that is above all other names (Phil. 2:9-11). He has complete authority over heaven and earth, and He exercises that authority according to His Father’s good purposes. However, not everyone acknowledges Jesus’ right to rule. Some reject His lordship and do whatever they think is best.
One day every person will acknowledge Christ’s authority. Just as God promised, all created beings in heaven, on earth, and under the earth will kneel before Him (Phil. 2:10). What a triumphant and glorious time that will be!
Even before that day, we who follow Christ are to live in submission to His will. If Jesus is our Lord, then our life revolves around Him and we exist for His purposes. Our submission to His will is a natural overflow of our love for Him and His love for us. It is not something we have to do; it’s something we get to do! Living in submission to the Lord gives us greater joy, peace, protection, and purpose than choosing to live our own way. Our choices will reflect the desire to be a living testimony to His lordship.
Surrendering control to Jesus Christ is the wisest—and most wonderful—decision we can make. Is He truly Lord of your life?
