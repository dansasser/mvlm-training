Fearfully and Wonderfully Made
God welcomes and empowers all who desire to serve Him—regardless of their past.
When God looked at the world He’d made, He declared it good. Making mankind in His image was the crowning achievement of His creative work (Genesis 1:27), and Psalm 139:14 reminds us that we are “fearfully and wonderfully made.” So wonderfully made, in fact, that the Lord has given each of His children great potential for service in His kingdom.
However, some of us doubt this is true—we wonder, How can I have awesome potential when there are so many ways I fall short?
Consider some well-known examples from Scripture. First, there’s Moses, who grew up in Pharaoh’s household and had many advantages. Then he killed an Egyptian and fled. But God looked beyond what Moses had done and saw who he could become. Next, Saul of Tarsus vehemently opposed those who believed in Jesus. Yet through God’s mercy, he became the apostle Paul, an evangelist who authored much of the New Testament. Lastly, the disciple Peter denied that he even knew Jesus. Still, the Lord chose him to lead and care for His church.
God sees the potential we have in Christ. Because we were made in His image and His Spirit dwells in us, we have a greater capacity for transformation and service than we could ever ask or imagine.
