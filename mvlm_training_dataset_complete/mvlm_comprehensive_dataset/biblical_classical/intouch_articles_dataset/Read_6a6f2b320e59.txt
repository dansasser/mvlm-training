A Small Matter of Obedience
God sees and rewards us every time we choose to obey Him—even when the decision seems insignificant.
Yesterday we learned that obeying God in small matters is essential to receiving His rewards. What He asks us to do is never insignificant—though we may not always recognize the importance of saying yes. Peter couldn’t have imagined the impact a simple boat trip would have in his life. But his obedience opened the door for God to bless him with a revolutionary ministry.
When we do what the Lord asks, He is pleased. But when we disobey, it costs us. God loves His children unconditionally and has a perfect plan for each one. Obeying Him ultimately will never prove disappointing, because when we do, our hearts open wide to let His power pour in.
As believers, we should ask what God wants us to do in daily situations (Matthew 6:11-12). We must learn to listen and be sensitive to His voice throughout the day. By keeping our mind attuned to Him, we’ll begin to understand the significance of some decisions we might otherwise barely notice. This awareness leads to a lifestyle of walking with the Lord and receiving His best for us.
Hindsight can help us recognize God’s blessings. Looking at the past year, can you see His wisdom in leading you to make right decisions? Make 2025 a year of obedience. Choose to trust Him, and receive the blessings He wants to give you.
