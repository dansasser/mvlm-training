When we follow the Holy Spirit's leading, we increasingly become like Christ.
By placing faith in Jesus, a person becomes a believer and is sanctified—that is, set apart for God’s purposes. Unlike salvation, which takes place in a single moment, sanctification is a lifelong process. We who are followers of the Savior should be letting the Spirit lead us. If that’s already the case, we are now being sanctified. In other words, we’re progressively maturing in our faith.
Logic dictates that for us to be progressing, we must be working our way toward something. Paul explained the Christian’s mission: “For those whom [God] foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son” (Romans 8:29). A believer’s character, conduct, and conversation should be reflections of Jesus. God has given each believer His Holy Spirit as a teacher and guide. The Spirit works to transform the mind and heart so that we reflect the Lord to those around us. When we allow the Spirit to direct us, we speak and act in accordance with our true identity as a child of God.
Our Father wants His children to be living examples of Him. However, He doesn’t expect perfection—He knows we can’t be totally sinless. But His Spirit will give guidance about how to think and act so we may “walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which [we] have been called” (Ephesians 4:1).
