## 🔧 Technical Innovations

### Shared Governance Architecture
```python
# Before: Separate networks for each component
policy_controller = PolicyController(hidden_dim, num_heads)
memory_manager = MemoryManager(hidden_dim, num_heads)  
trace_generator = TraceGenerator(hidden_dim, num_heads)

# After: Shared backbone with specialized heads
governance_backbone = SharedGovernanceBackbone(hidden_dim, governance_dim//2, num_heads)
```

### Optimized MoE Routing
```python
# Before: Token-by-token processing
for expert_idx in range(num_experts):
    mask = expert_indices == expert_idx
    if mask.any():
        tokens_for_expert = x_flat[mask]
        expert_output = experts[expert_idx](tokens_for_expert)

# After: Vectorized batched processing
expert_positions = (top_k_indices == expert_idx)
token_indices, k_positions = expert_positions.nonzero(as_tuple=True)
expert_tokens = x_flat[token_indices]
expert_output = experts[expert_idx](expert_tokens)
```

### Intelligent Attention Caching
```python
# Cache key based on governance signatures
cache_key = f"seq_{seq_len}_heads_{num_heads}_gov_{gov_hash}_proph_{proph_hash}"

# Try cache first, compute if miss
cached_attn = cache.get_pattern(seq_len, num_heads, governance_outputs)
if cached_attn is None:
    attn_weights = compute_attention(...)
    cache.store_pattern(attn_weights, ...)
```
