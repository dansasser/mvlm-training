## Agent Workflow Patterns

### For Code Analysis Tasks
1. **Repository Structure**: Start with understanding the two-model setup
2. **Import Dependencies**: Check imports carefully - Enhanced SIM-ONE uses modern components
3. **Dataset Paths**: Both models use `mvlm_training_dataset_complete/` from root
4. **Configuration**: Enhanced model uses `PrioritaryConfig` with modern defaults

### For Enhancement Tasks
1. **Architecture Focus**: Enhanced SIM-ONE is where modern improvements go
2. **Tokenization**: Use `BiblicalBPETokenizer` (32K vocab) over character-level
3. **Attention**: `EnhancedGovernanceAttention` with RoPE encoding
4. **Feedforward**: `SwiGLU` layers instead of standard MLP
5. **Normalization**: `RMSNorm` preferred over LayerNorm

### For Training Tasks
1. **Automated Pipeline**: Use `train_all_models.py` for sequential training
2. **Individual Training**: Use respective trainer scripts directly
3. **H200 Setup**: Run `setup_environment.sh` first
4. **Validation**: Always run `validate_models.py` after training
5. **Download Prep**: Models auto-compressed to `models_for_download/`

## Common Agent Patterns

### When Working with SIM-ONE Training Directory
```python
# Correct imports for Enhanced SIM-ONE
from simone_transformer import EnhancedSIMONEModel
from prioritary_mvlm import EnhancedPrioritaryTrainer, AdvancedBPETokenizer
from prioritary_mvlm.advanced_losses import ComprehensiveTrainingLoss

# Dataset path from SIM-ONE Training directory
data_dir = "../mvlm_training_dataset_complete"
```

### When Analyzing Model Performance
- **MVLM-GPT2**: Focus on text coherence, traditional language modeling metrics
- **Enhanced SIM-ONE**: Emphasize modern architectural advantages, efficiency gains, advanced reasoning
- **Comparison**: Enhanced model should show superior performance/efficiency for general tasks
