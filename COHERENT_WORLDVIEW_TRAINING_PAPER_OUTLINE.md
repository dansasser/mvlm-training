## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Training Data Quality Problem
- Current LLMs trained on contradictory, high-noise web data
- Models learn to hedge, equivocate, or give inconsistent answers
- Internal model confusion from conflicting "truths" in training data
- Quality vs. quantity trade-offs in current approaches

### 1.2 Existing Approaches and Limitations
- Web scraping approaches (Common Crawl, Reddit, Wikipedia)
- Content filtering by topic vs. epistemological consistency
- Human feedback methods (RLHF) as post-training corrections
- Limitations of current data curation methodologies

### 1.3 Our Contribution
- **Coherent Worldview Training (CWT)**: Using shared epistemological foundations
- Data quality through philosophical consistency rather than topic filtering
- Measurable reduction in model contradictions and improved reasoning
- Scalable methodology for principled data curation
